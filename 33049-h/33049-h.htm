<p class="figcenter" style="margin-top: 4em;"><big>PREFACE.</big>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_i" id="Page_i">[Pg i]</a></span></p>


<p>The scope of this work is in the main identical with that of
"Archaia," published in 1860; but in attempting to prepare a new
edition brought up to the present condition of the subject, it was
found that so much required to be rewritten as to make it essentially
a new book, and it was therefore decided to give it a new name, more
clearly indicating its character and purpose.</p>

<p>The intention of this new publication is to throw as much light as
possible on the present condition of the much-agitated questions
respecting the origin of the world and its inhabitants. To students of
the Bible it will afford the means of determining the precise import
of the biblical references to creation, and of their relation to what
is known from other sources. To geologists and biologists it is
intended to give some intelligible explanation of the connection of
the doctrines of revealed religion with the results of their
respective sciences.</p>

<p>A still higher end to which the author would gladly contribute is that
of aiding thoughtful men perplexed with the apparent antagonisms of
science and religion, and of indicating how they may best harmonize
our great and growing knowledge of nature with our old and cherished
beliefs as to the origin and destiny of man.</p>

<p>In aiming at these results, it has not been thought necessary to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
assume a controversial attitude or to stand on the defensive, either
with regard to religion or science, but rather to attempt to arrive at
broad and comprehensive views which may exhibit those higher harmonies
of the spiritual and the natural which they derive from their common
Author, and which reach beyond the petty difficulties arising from
narrow or imperfect views of either or both. Such an aim is too high
to be fully attained, but in so far as it can be reached we may hope
to rescue science from a dry and barren infidelity, and religion from
mere fruitless sentiment or enfeebling superstition.</p>

<p>Since the publication of "Archaia," the subject of which it treats has
passed through several phases, but the author has seen no reason to
abandon in the least degree the principles of interpretation on which
he then insisted, and he takes a hopeful view as to their ultimate
prevalence. It is true that the wide acceptance of hypotheses of
"evolution" has led to a more decided antagonism than heretofore
between some of the utterances of scientific men and the religious
ideas of mankind, and to a contemptuous disregard of revealed religion
in the more shallow literature of the time; but, on the other hand, a
barrier of scientific fact and induction has been slowly rising to
stem this current of crude and rash hypothesis. Of this nature are the
great discoveries as to the physical constitution and probable origin
of the universe, the doctrine of the correlation and conservation of
forces, the new estimates of the age of the earth, the overthrow of
the doctrine of spontaneous generation, the high bodily and mental
type of the earliest known men, the light which philology has thrown
on the unity of language, our growing knowledge of the uniformity of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
the constructive and other habits of primitive men, and of the
condition of man in the earlier historic time, the greater
completeness of our conceptions as to the phenomena of life and their
relation to organizable matters&mdash;all these and many other aspects of
the later progress of science must tend to bring it back into greater
harmony with revealed religion.</p>

<p>On the other side, there has been a growing disposition on the part of
theologians to inquire as to the actual views of nature presented in
the Bible, and to separate these from those accretions of obsolete
philosophy which have been too often confounded with them. With
respect to the first chapter of Genesis more especially, there has
been a decided growth in the acceptance of those principles for which
I contended in 1860. In illustration of this I may refer to the fact
that in 1862 it was precisely on these principles that Dr. McCaul
conducted his able defence of the Mosaic record of creation in the
"Aids to Faith," which may almost be regarded as an authoritative
expression of the views of orthodox Christians in opposition to those
of the once notorious "Essays and Reviews." Equally significant is the
adoption of this method of interpretation by Dr. Tayler Lewis in his
masterly "Special Introduction" to the first chapter of Genesis, in
the American edition of Lange's Commentary, edited by Dr. Philip
Schaff; and the manifest approval with which the lucid statement of
the relations of Geology and the Bible by Dr. Arnold Guyot, was
received by the great gathering of divines at the Convention of the
Evangelical Alliance in New York, in 1873, bears testimony to the same
fact. The author has also had the honor of being invited to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
illustrate this mode of reconciliation to the students of two of the
most important theological colleges in America, in lectures afterwards
published and widely circulated.</p>

<p>The time is perhaps nearer than we anticipate when Natural Science and
Theology will unite in the conviction that the first chapter of
Genesis "stands alone among the traditions of mankind in the wonderful
simplicity and grandeur of its words," and that "the meaning of these
words is always a meaning ahead of science&mdash;not because it anticipates
the results of science, but because it is independent of them, and
runs as it were round the outer margin of all possible discovery."

<p>In the Appendix the reader will find several short essays on special
points collateral to the general subject, and important in the
solution of some of its difficulties, but which could not be
conveniently included in the text. More especially I would refer to
the summaries given in the Appendix of the present state of our
knowledge as to the origin of life, of species, and of man&mdash;topics not
discussed in much detail in the body of the work, both because of the
wide fields of controversy to which they lead, and because I have
treated of them somewhat fully in a previous work, "The Story of the
Earth and Man," in which the detailed history of life as disclosed by
science was the main subject in hand.</p>

<h1>THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD.</h1>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br /><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">THE MYSTERY OF ORIGINS AND ITS SOLUTIONS.</span><br /><br />

<span  style="font-size:50%;">"The things that are seen are temporal."&mdash;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Paul.</span></span></h2>


<p>Have we or can we have any certain solution of those two great
questions&mdash;Whence are all things? and Whither do all things tend?
No thinking man is content to live merely in a transitory
present, ever emerging out of darkness and ever returning thither
again, without knowing any thing of the origin and issue of the
world and its inhabitants. Yet it would seem that to-day men are
as much in uncertainty on these subjects as at any previous time.
It even appears as if all our added knowledge would only, for a
time at least, deprive us of the solutions to which we trusted,
and give no others in their room. Christians have been accustomed
to rest on the cosmogony and prophecy of the Bible; but we are
now frankly told on all hands that these are valueless, and that
even ministers of religion more or less "sacrifice their
sincerity" in making them the basis of their teachings. On the
other hand, we are informed that nothing can be discerned in the
universe beyond matter and force, and that it is by a purely
material and spontaneous evolution that all things exist. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
when we ask as to the origin of matter and force, and the laws
which regulate them&mdash;as to the end to which their movement is
tending, as to the manner in which they have evolved the myriad
forms of life and the human intelligence itself&mdash;the only answer
is that these are "insoluble mysteries."</p>

<p>Are we, then, to fall back on the real or imagined revelations
and traditions of the past, and to endeavor to find in them some
foothold of assurance; or are we to wait till further progress in
science may have cleared up some of the present mysteries?
Whatever may be said of the former alternative, all honest
students of science will unite with me in the admission that the
latter is hopeless. We need not seek to belittle the magnificent
triumphs of modern science. They have been real and stupendous.
But it is of their very nature to conduct us to ultimate facts
and laws of which science can give no explanation; and the
further we push our inquiries the more insuperably does the wall
of mystery rise before us. It is true we can furnish the
materials for philosophical speculations which may be built on
scientific facts and principles; but these are in their nature
uncertain, and must constantly change as knowledge advances. They
can not solve for us the great practical problems of our origin
and destiny.</p>

<p>In these circumstances no apology is needed for a thorough and
careful inquiry into those foundations of religious belief which
rest on the idea of a revelation of origins and destinies made to
man from without, and on which we may build the superstructure of
a rational religion, giving guidance for the present and hope for
the future. In the following pages I propose to enter upon so
much of this subject as relates to the origin and earliest
history of the world, in so far as these are treated of in the
Bible and in the traditions of the more ancient nations; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
this with reference to the present standpoint of science in
relation to these questions.</p>

<p>To discuss such questions at all, certain preliminary admissions
are necessary. These are: (1) The reality of an unseen universe,
spiritual rather than material in its nature. (2) The existence
of a personal God, or of a great Universal Will. (3) The
possibility of communication taking place between God and man. I
do not propose to attempt any proof of these positions, but it
may be well to explain what they mean.</p>

<p>(1) That the great machine for the dissipation of energy, in
which we exist, and which we call the universe, must have a
correlative and complement in the unseen, is a conclusion now
forced upon physicists by the necessities of the doctrine of the
conservation of force. In short, it seems that, unless we admit
this conclusion, we can not believe in the possible existence of
the material universe itself, and must sink into absolute
nihilism. This doctrine is expressed by the apostle Paul in the
statement, "The things that are seen are temporal, but the things
that are not seen are eternal," and it has been ably discussed by
the authors of the remarkable work, "The Unseen Universe." That
this unseen world is spiritual&mdash;that is, not subject to the same
material laws with the visible universe&mdash;is also a fair deduction
from physical science, as well as a doctrine of Scripture. I
prefer the term spiritual to supernatural, because the first is
the term used in the Bible, and because the latter has had
associated with it ideas of the miraculous and abnormal, not
implied at all in the idea of the spiritual, which in some
important senses may be more natural than the material.</p>

<p>(2) The idea of a personal God implies not merely the existence
of an unknown absolute power, as Herbert Spencer seems to hold,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
or of "an Eternal, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness,"
as Matthew Arnold puts it, but of a Being of whom we can affirm
will, intelligence, feeling, self-consciousness, not certainly
precisely as they occur in us, but in a higher and more perfect
form, of which our own consciousness furnishes the type, or
"image and shadow," as Moses long ago phrased it. On the one
hand, it is true that we can not fully comprehend such a personal
God, because not limited by the conditions which limit us. On the
other hand, it is clear that our intellect, as constituted, can
furnish us with no ultimate explanation of the universe except in
the action of such a primary personal will. In the Bible the
absolute personality of God is expressed by the title "I am." His
intimate relation to us is indicated by the expression, "In him
we live, and move, and have our being." His all-pervading essence
is stated as "the fullness of him that filleth all in all." His
relative personality is shadowed forth by the attribution to him
of love, anger, and other human feelings and sentiments, and by
presenting him in the endearing relation of the universal Father.</p>

<p>(3) With reference to the possibility of communication between
God and man, it may truly be said that such communication is not
only possible, but infinitely probable. God is not only near to
us, but we are in him, and, independently of the testimony of
revelation, it has been felt by all classes of men, from the
rudest and most primitive savages up to our great English
philosopher, John Stuart Mill, that if there is a God, he can not
be excluded from communion with his intelligent creatures, either
directly or through the medium of ministering spirits.

Farther, placed as man is in the midst of complex and to him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
inexplicable phenomena, involved in a conflict of good and evil,
happiness and misery, to which the wisest and the greatest minds
have found no issue, subject to be degraded by low passions and
tempted to great extremes of evil, and himself weak, impulsive,
and vacillating, there seems the most urgent need for divine
communication. It may be said that these are conflicts and
problems which God has left man to decide and solve for himself
by his own reason. But when we consider how slow this process is,
and how imperfect even now, after the experience of ages, we seem
to need some intervention that shall stimulate the human mind,
and impel it forward with greater rapidity. Farther, it would
appear only right that an intelligent and accountable being,
placed in a world like this, should have some explanation of his
origin and destiny given him at first, and that, if he should
perchance go astray, a helping hand should be extended to him.</p>

<p>Practically it is an historical fact that all the great impulses
given to humanity have been by men claiming divine guidance or
inspiration, and professing to bring light and truth from the
unseen world. It would be too much to say that all these prophets
and reformers have been inspired of heaven; but scarcely too much
to say that they have either received a message of God, or have
been permitted to transmit to our world messages for weal or woe
from powers without in subordination to him. Farther, we shall
have reason in the sequel to see that in far back prehistoric
times there must have been impulses given to mankind, and
revelations made to them, as potent as those which have acted in
later historic periods. In Holy Scripture the Word of God is
represented as "enlightening every man;
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
" and with reference to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
our present subject we are told that "by faith we understand that
the ages of the world were constituted by the Word of God, so
that the visible things were not made of those which appear."
<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
In other words, that the will of God has been active and
operative as the sole cause throughout all ages of the world's
creation and history, and that the visible universe is not a mere
product of its own phenomena. We may call this faith, if we
please, an intuition or instinct, a God-given gift, or a product
of our own thought acting on evidence afforded by the outer
world; but in any case it seems to be the sole possible solution
of the mystery of origins.</p>

<p>These points being premised, we are in a position to inquire as
to the teaching of our own Holy Scriptures, and in this inquiry
we can easily take along with them all other revelations,
pretended or true, that deal with our subject.</p>

<p>Max M&uuml;ller, in his lectures on the Science of Religion, rejects
the ordinary division into natural and revealed, and adopts a
threefold grouping, corresponding to the great division of
languages into Turanian, Aryan, and Semitic. With some
modification and explanation, this classification will serve well
our present purpose. As to natural and revealed religions, if we
regard our own as revealed, we must admit an element of
revelation in all others as well. According to the Hebrew
Scriptures revelation began in Eden, and was continued more or
less in all successive ages up to the apostolic times.
Consequently the earlier revelations of the antediluvian and
postdiluvian times must have been the common property of all
races, and must have been associated with whatever elements of
natural religion they had. When, therefore, we call our religion
distinctively a revealed one, we must admit that traces of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
same revelation may be found in all others. On the other hand,
when we characterize our religion as Hebrew or Semitic, we must
bear in mind that in its earlier stages it was not so limited;
but that, if as old as it professes to be, it must include a
substratum common to it with the old religions of the Turanians
and Aryans. Neglect of these very simple considerations often
leads to great confusion in the minds both of Christians and
unbelievers, as to the relation of Christianity to heathenism,
and especially to the older and more primitive forms of
heathenism.</p>

<p>The Turanian stock, of which the Mongolian peoples of Northern
Asia may be taken as the type, includes also the American races,
and the oldest historical populations of Western Asia and of
Europe; and they are the peoples who, in their physical features
and their art tendencies, most nearly resemble the prehistoric
men of the caves and gravels. They largely consist of the
populations which the Bible affiliates with Ham. They are
remarkable for their permanent and stationary forms of
civilization or barbarism, and for the languages least developed
in grammatical structure. These people had and still have
traditions of the creation and early history of man similar to
those in the earlier Biblical books; but the connection of their
religions with that of the Bible breaks off from the time of
Abraham; and the earlier portions of revelation which they
possessed became disintegrated into a polytheism which takes very
largely the form of animism, or of attributing some special
spiritual indwelling to all natural objects, and also that of
worship of ancestors and heroes. The portion of primitive
theological belief to which they have clung most persistently is
the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, which in all their
religious beliefs occupies a prominent place, and has always been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
connected with special attention to rites of sepulture and
monuments to the dead. Their version of the revelation of
creation appears most distinctly in the sacred book of the
Quich&eacute;s of Central America, and in the creation myths of the
Mexicans, Iroquois, Algonquins, and other North American tribes;
and it has been handed down to us through the Semitic Assyrians
from the ancient Chald&aelig;o-turanian population of the valley of the
Euphrates.</p>

<p>The Aryan races have been remarkable for their changeable and
versatile character. Their religious ideas in the most primitive
times appear to have been not dissimilar from those of the
Turanians; and the Indians, Persians, Greeks, Scandinavians, and
Celts have all gone some length in developing and modifying
these, apparently by purely human imaginative and intellectual
materials. But all these developments were defective in a moral
point of view, and had lost the stability and rational basis
which proceed from monotheism. Hence they have given way before
other and higher faiths; and at this day the more advanced
nations of the Aryan, or in Scriptural language the Japhetic
stock, have adopted the Semitic faith; and, as Noah long ago
predicted, "dwell in the tents of Shem." No indigenous account of
the genesis of things remains among the Aryan races, with the
exception of that in the Avesta, and in some ancient Hindoo
hymns, and these are merely variations of the Turanian or Semitic
cosmogony. God has given to the Aryans no special revelations of
his will, and they would have been left to grope for themselves
along the paths of science and philosophy, but for the advent
among them of the prophets of "Jehovah the God of Shem."</p>

<p>It is to the Semitic race that God has been most liberal in his
gift of inspiration. Gathering up and treasuring the old common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
inheritance of religion, and eliminating from it the accretions
of superstition, the children of Abraham at one time stood alone,
or almost alone, as adherents of a belief in one God the Creator.
Their theology was added to from age to age by a succession of
prophets, all working in one line of development, till it
culminated in the appearance of Jesus Christ, and then proceeded
to expand itself over the other races. Among them it has
undergone two remarkable phases of retrograde development&mdash;the
one in Mohammedanism, which carries it back to a resemblance to
its own earlier patriarchal stage, the other in Roman and Greek
ecclesiasticism, which have taken it back to the Levitical
system, along with a strong color of paganism. Still its original
documents survive, and retain their hold on large portions of the
more enlightened Aryan nations, while through their means these
documents have entered on a new career of conquest among the
Semites and Turanians. They are, however, it must be admitted,
among the Aryan races of Europe, growing in a somewhat
uncongenial soil; partly because of the materialistic
organization of these races, and partly because of the abundant
remains of heathenism which still linger among them; and it is
possible that they may not realize their full triumphs over
humanity till the Semitic races return to the position of
Abraham, and erect again in the world the standard of
monotheistic faith, under the auspices of a purified
Christianity.</p>

<p>It follows from this hasty survey that it is the Semitic solution
of the question of origins, as contained in the Hebrew
Scriptures, that mainly concerns us; and in the first place we
must consider the foundation and historical development of this
solution, as many misconceptions prevail on these points. We may
discuss these subjects under the heads of the Abrahamic Genesis
and the Mosaic Genesis, and may in a subsequent chapter consider
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the results of these in the Genesis of the later Scripture
writers.</p>


<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 3em;">THE ABRAHAMIC GENESIS.</p>

<p>It has been a favorite theory with some learned men that the
earlier parts of the book of Genesis existed as ancient documents
even in the time of Moses, and were incorporated by him in his
work, and attempts have been made to separate, on various
grounds, the older from the newer portions. Until lately,
however, these attempts have been altogether conjectural and
destitute of any positive basis of arch&aelig;ological fact. A new and
interesting aspect has been given to them by the recent readings
of the inscriptions on clay tablets found at Nineveh, and to
which especial attention has been given by the late Mr. G. Smith,
of the Arch&aelig;ological Department of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Assurbanipal, king of Assyria, one of the kings known to the
Greeks by the name of Sardanapalus, reigned at Nineveh about B.C.
673. He was a grandson of the Biblical Sennacherib, and son of
Esarhaddon, and it seems that he had inherited from his fathers a
library of Chaldean and Assyrian literature, written not on
perishable paper or parchment, but on tablets of clay, and
containing much ancient lore of the nations inhabiting the
valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates. Assurbanipal, living when
the Assyrian empire had attained to the acme of its greatness,
had leisure to become a greater patron of learning than any
preceding king. His scribes ransacked the record chambers of the
oldest temples in the world; and Babel, Erech, Accad, and Ur had
to yield up their treasures of history and theology to diligent
copyists, who transcribed them in beautiful arrow-head characters
on new clay tablets, and deposited them in the library of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
great king. It would appear that, at the same time, these
documents were edited, archaic forms of expression translated,
and lacun&aelig; caused by decay or fracture repaired. They were also
inscribed with legends stating the sources whence they had been
derived.</p>

<p>The empire of Assyria went down in blood, and its palaces were
destroyed with fire, but the imperishable clay tablets which had
formed the treasure of their libraries remained, more or less
broken it is true, among the ruins. Exhumed by Layard and Smith,
they are now among the collections of the British Museum, and
their decipherment is throwing a new and strange light on the
cosmogony and religions of the early East. Though the date of the
writing of these tablets is comparatively modern, being about the
time of the later kings of Judah, the original records from which
they were transcribed profess to have been very ancient&mdash;some of
them about 1600 years before the time of Assurbanipal, so that
they go back to a time anterior to that of the early Hebrew
patriarchs. Their genuineness has been endorsed, in one case, by
the discovery by Mr. Loftus, in the city of Senkereh, of an
apparent original, bearing date about 1600 years before Christ,
and other inscriptions of equal or greater antiquity have been
found in the ruins of Ur, on the Euphrates. Nor does there seem
any reason to doubt that the scribes of Assurbanipal faithfully
transcribed the oldest records extant in their time. Their care
and diligence are also shown by the fact that where different
versions of these records existed in different cities, they have
made copies of these variant manuscripts, instead of attempting
to reduce them to one text. The subjects treated of in the
Nineveh tablets are very various, but those that concern our
present purpose are the documents relating to the creation, the
fall of man, and the deluge, of which considerable portions have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
been recovered, and have been translated by Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>These documents carry us back to a time when the Turanian
religions had not yet been separated from the Semitic. The early
Chaldeans, termed Cushites in the Bible, and who under Nimrod
seem to have established the first empire in that region, are now
known to have been Turanian; and among them apparently arose at a
very early period a literature and a mythology. The Chaldeans
were politically subjugated by the Semitic Assyrians, but they
retained their religious predominance; and until a comparatively
late period existed as a learned and priestly caste. To these
primitive <i>Chasdim</i> were undoubtedly due the creation legends
collected by the scribes of Assurbanipal. They were obtained in
the old Chaldean cities, in the temples under the guardianship of
Chaldean priests; and their date carries them back to a time
anterior to the Assyrian conquest, and in which Chaldean kings
still reigned. Here, then, we have an important connecting link
between the cosmogonies of the Turanian and Semitic races; and
leaving out of sight for the present the legends of the deluge
and other matters allied to it, we may inquire as to the nature
and contents of the Assyrian and Chaldean record of creation.</p>

<p>The Assyrian Genesis is similar in order and arrangement to that
in our own Bible, and gives the same general order of the
creative work. Its days, however, of creation, as indeed there is
good internal evidence to prove those of Moses also are, seem to
be periods or ages. It treats of the creation of gods, as well as
of the universe, and thus introduces a polytheistic system; and
it seems to recognize, like the Avesta, a primitive principle of
evil, presiding over chaos, and subsequently introducing evil
among men. These points may be illustrated by an extract from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Mr. Smith's translation. It relates to the earlier part of the
work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">"When above were not raised the heavens,<br />
And below on the earth a plant had not grown up<br />
The deep also had not broken up its boundaries<br />
Chaos (or water) Tiamat (the sea or abyss) was the producing mother<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">of them all</span><br />
These waters at the beginning were ordained<br />
But a tree had not grown a flower had not unfolded<br />
When the gods had not sprung up any one of them<br />
A plant had not grown and order did not exist<br />
Were made also the great gods<br />
The gods Lahma and Lahamu they caused to come * * *<br />
And they grew * * *<br />
The gods Sar and Kisar were made<br />
A course of days and a long time passed<br />
The god Anu * * *<br />
The gods Sar and * * *"</p>

<p>Here the first existences are Chaos (Mummu, or confusion) and
Tiamat, which is the Thalatth of Berosus, representing the sea or
primitive abyss, but also recognized as a female deity or first
mother. Then we have Lahma and Lahamu, which represent power or
motion in nature, and are the equivalents of the Divine Spirit
moving on the face of the waters in our Genesis. Next we have the
production of Sar or Iloar and Kisar, representing the expanse or
firmament. Sar is supposed to be the god Assur of the Assyrians,
a great weather god, and after whom their nation and its founder
were named. The next process is the creation of the heaven and
the earth, represented by Anu and Anatu. Anu was always one of
the greater gods, and was identified with the higher or starry
heavens. In succeeding tablets to this we find Bel or Belus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
introduced, as the agent in the creation of animals and of men;
and he is the true Demiurgus or Mediator of the Assyrian system.
Next we have the introduction of Hea or Saturn, who is the
equivalent of the Biblical Adam, and of Ishtar, mother of men,
who is the Isba or Eve of Genesis. The rest of this legend
evidently relates to deified men, among whom are Merodach, Nebo,
and other heroes.</p>

<p>The first remark that we may make on this Assyrian Genesis is
that, while it resembles generally the Mosaic account of
creation, it also strongly resembles the old cosmogonies of the
Egyptians and Persians, and those of the widely scattered
Turanians of Northern Asia and of America. As an extreme
illustration of this, and to obviate the necessity of digression
at this point of our inquiry, I introduce here some extracts from
the Popul Vuh, or sacred book of the Quich&eacute; Indians of Central
America, an undoubted product of prehistoric religion in the
western continent.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
</p>

<p style="font-size:70%;">"And the heaven was formed, and all the signs thereof set in
their angle and alignment, and its boundaries fixed toward
the four winds by the Creator and Former, and Mother and
Father of life and existence&mdash;he by whom all move and
breathe, the Father and Cherisher of the peace of nations
and of the civilization of his people&mdash;he whose wisdom has
projected the excellence of all that is on the earth or in
the lakes or in the sea."</p>

<p style="font-size:70%;">"Behold the first word and the first discourse. There was
yet no man nor any animal, * * * nothing was but the
firmament. The face of the earth had not yet appeared over
the peaceful sea, and all the space of heaven * * * nothing
but immobility and silence in the night."</p>

<p style="font-size:70%;">"Alone also the Creator, the Former, the Dominator, the
Feathered Serpent&mdash;those that engender, those that give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
being&mdash;they are upon the water like a growing light. They
are enveloped in green and blue, and therefore their name is
Gucumatz."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
</p>

<p style="font-size:70%;">"Lo now how the heavens exist, how exists also the Heart of
Heaven; such is the name of God. It is thus that he is
called. And they spake, they consulted together and
meditated; they mingled their words and their opinions."</p>

<p style="font-size:70%;">"And the creation [of the earth] was verily after this wise.
Earth, they said, and on the instant it was formed; like a
cloud or a fog was its beginning. Then the mountains rose
over the water like great fishes; in an instant the
mountains and the plains were visible, and the cypress and
the pine appeared. Then was the Gucumatz filled with joy,
crying out: Blessed be thy coming, O Heart of Heaven,
Hurakan, Thunderbolt. Our work and our labor has
accomplished its end."</p>

<p>This corresponds to the work of the first four creative days; and
next details are given as to the introduction of animals, with
which, however, the Creator is represented as dissatisfied,
because they could not know or invoke the Creator. They are
therefore condemned to be subject to be devoured one of another.
Again there is a council in heaven, and the gods determine to
make man. But he also is imperfect, for he has speech without
intelligence: so he is condemned to be destroyed by water. A new
council is held, and a second race of men produced; but this
fails in the capacity for religious worship&mdash;"they forgot the
Heart of Heaven." These were partly destroyed by fire and partly
converted into apes. Lastly another council is held, and perfect
men created. Then follows a remarkable series of stories relating
to the early history and migrations of men.</p>

<p>It is known that similar creation myths existed among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Mexicans and other early civilized nations of America, and in
ruder and more grotesque forms even among the semi-barbarous and
hunter tribes. Their connection with the ancient Semitic and
Turanian revelations of Asia is unquestionable.</p>

<p>We have thus in the Assyrian Genesis a relic of early religious
belief belonging to a period when such widely separated stocks as
the Assyrian and American were still one: to a period, therefore,
presumably long anterior to that of Moses. Yet at this very early
period the central portions at least of the Turanian race had
already devised some means of recording their traditions in
writing&mdash;probably the arrow-head writing, afterwards used by the
Assyrians, had already been invented. Again, at this early period
a complex polytheism had already sprung up, and this was
connected with cosmological ideas, inasmuch as the primitive
abyss, the firmament, the starry heavens, the principle of life,
were all subordinate gods; and so were also some of the earliest
of the patriarchs of the human race. It is possible, however,
that this was among the early Chaldeans an exoteric
representation for the vulgar, and that the priestly caste may
have understood it in a monotheistic sense. In any case, the idea
of a Supreme Creator remains behind the whole. Farther, in the
early Chaldean record we have a more detailed and expanded
document than that of the Hebrew Genesis, probably intended for
the popular ear, and to include as much as possible of the
current mythology. As an example, I quote the following in
relation to the creation of the moon, being apparently a part of
the narrative of that creative period corresponding with the
fourth day of Genesis:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">"In its mass [that is, of the lower chaos] he made a boiling,<br />
The God Uru [the moon] he caused to rise out, the night he overshadowed.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
To fix it also for the light of the night until the shining of the day,<br />
That the month might not be broken and in its amount be regular.<br />
At the beginning of the month at the rising of the night,<br />
His horns are breaking through to shine in the heavens.<br />
On the seventh day to a circle he begins to swell,<br />
And stretches toward the dawn farther."</p>

<p>We now come to the historical connection of all this with Abraham
and with the Hebrew Scriptures. The early life of the "Father of
the Faithful" belongs to the time when Turanian and Semitic
elements were mingled in the Euphratean valley. Himself of the
stock of Shem, he dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees, a city in whose
ruins, now known by the name of Mugheir, Chaldean inscriptions
have been found of a date anterior to that of the patriarch. In
the time of Abraham a polytheistic religion already existed in
Ur, for we are told that his father "served other gods." Further,
the legends of the creation and the deluge, and the antediluvian
age, with the history of Nimrod and other postdiluvian heroes,
existed in a written form; and, strange though this may seem,
there can be little doubt that Abraham, before he left Ur of the
Chaldees, had read the same creation legends that have so
recently been translated and published by Mr. Smith. But
Abraham's relation to these was of a peculiar kind. With a
spiritual enlightenment beyond that of his age, he dissented from
the Turanian animism and polytheism, and maintained that pure and
spiritual monotheism which, according to the Bible, had been the
original faith of the sons of Noah. But he was overborne by the
tendencies of his time, and probably by the royal and priestly
influence then dominant in Chaldea, and he went forth from his
native land in search of a country where he might have freedom to
worship God. It is thus that Abraham appears as the earliest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
reformer, the first of those martyrs of conscience who fear not
to differ from the majority, the father and prototype of the
faithful of every age, and the earliest apostle of the
monotheistic faith which still reigns among all the higher races
of men.</p>

<p>Did Abraham take with him in his pilgrimage the records of his
people? It is scarcely possible to doubt that he did, and this
probably in a written form, but purified from the polytheism and
inane imaginations accreted upon them; or perhaps he had access
to still older and more primitive records anterior to the rise of
the Turanian superstitions. In any case we may safely infer that
Abraham and his tribe carried with them the substance of all that
part of Genesis which contains the history of the world up to his
time, and that this would be a precious heir-loom of his family,
until it was edited and incorporated in the Pentateuch by his
great descendant Moses. It seems plain, therefore, that the
original prophet or seer to whom the narrative of creation was
revealed lived before Abraham, but we need not doubt that the
latter had the benefit of divine guidance in his noble stand
against the idolatry of his age, and in his selection of the
documents on which his own theology was based. These
considerations help us to understand the persistence of Hebrew
monotheism in the presence of the idolatries of Canaan and Egypt,
since these were closely allied to the Chaldean system against
which Abraham had protested. They also explain the recognition by
Abraham, as co-religionists, of such monotheistic personages as
Melchisedec, king of Salem. They further illustrate the nature of
the religious basis in his people's beliefs on which Moses had to
work, and on which he founded his theocratic system.</p>

<p>Before leaving this part of the subject, I would observe that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
view above given; while it explains the agreement between the
Hebrew Genesis and other ancient religious beliefs, is in strict
accordance with the teachings of Genesis itself. The history
given there implies monotheism and knowledge of God as the
Creator and Redeemer, in antediluvian and early postdiluvian
times, a decadence from this into a systematic polytheism at a
very early date, the protest and dissent of Abraham, his call of
God to be the upholder of a purer faith, and the maintenance of
that faith by his descendants. Besides this, any careful reader
of Genesis and of the book of Job, which, whatever its origin,
must be more ancient than the Mosaic law, will readily discover
indications that Abraham and the patriarchs were in the
possession of documents and traditions of the same purport with
those in the early chapters of Genesis, and that these were to
them their only sacred literature. The reader of the Pentateuch
must carry this idea with him, if he would have any clear
conception of the unity and symmetry of these remarkable books.</p>


<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 3em;">THE MOSAIC GENESIS.</p>

<p>In the period of 400 years intervening between Abraham's
departure from Ur and the exodus of Israel from Egypt, no great
prophetic mind, like that of the Father of the Faithful, appeared
among the Hebrews. But then arose Moses, the greatest figure in
all antiquity before the advent of Christ, and who was destined
to give permanence and world-wide prevalence to the faith for
which Abraham had sacrificed so much. Under the leadership of
Moses, the Abrahamid&aelig;, now reduced to the condition of a serf
population, emancipated themselves from Egyptian bondage, and,
after forty years of wandering desert life, settled themselves
permanently on the hills and in the valleys of Palestine. The
voice of the ruling race, indistinctly conveyed to us from that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
distant antiquity, maintains that the fugitive slaves were an
abject and contemptible herd; but the leader of the exodus
informs us that, though cruelly trodden down by a haughty despot,
they were of noble parentage, the heirs of high hopes and
promises. Their migration is certainly the most remarkable
national movement in the world's history&mdash;remarkable, not merely
in its events and immediate circumstances, but in its remote
political, literary, and moral results. The rulers of Egypt,
polished, enlightened, and practical men, were yet the devotees
of a complicated system of hero and animal worship, like that
from which Abraham dissented, and derived in great part from the
"animism" which caused some of the oldest nations of the world to
associate a spiritual indwelling with the natural objects
surrounding them; or, if they had ceased to believe in this, they
had sunk into a materialistic devotion to the good things of the
present world, combined with a superstitious belief in the
efficacy of priestly absolution.</p>

<p>The slaves, leaving all this behind them, rose in their religious
opinions to the pure and spiritual monotheism of the great father
of their race; and their leader presented to them a law
unequalled up to our time in its union of justice, patriotism,
and benevolence, and established among them, for the first time
in the world's history, a free constitutional republic. Nor is
this all; unexampled though such results are elsewhere in the
case of serfs suddenly emancipated. The Hebrew lawgiver has
interwoven his institutions in a great historical composition,
including the grand and simple cosmogony of the patriarchs, a
detailed account of the affiliation and ethnological relations of
the races of men, and a narrative of the fortunes of his own
people; intimating not only that they were a favored and chosen
race, but that of them was to arise a great Deliverer, who would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
bless all nations with pardon and with peace,
<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
 and would solve
once for all those great problems of the relations of man to God
and the unseen world, which in the time of Moses as in our own
were the most momentous of all, and gave to questions of origins
all their practical value.</p>

<p>The lawgiver passed to his rest. His laws and literature,
surviving through many vicissitudes, have produced in each
succeeding age a new harvest of poetry and history, leavened with
their own spirit. In the mean time the learning and the
superstition of Egypt faded from the eyes of men. The splendid
political and military organizations of Assyria, Babylon, Persia,
and Macedon arose and crumbled into dust. The wonderful
literature of Greece blazed forth and expired. That of Rome, a
reflex and copy of the former, had reached its culminating point;
and no prophet had arisen among any of these Gentile nations to
teach them the truth of God. The world, with all its national
liberties crushed out, its religion and its philosophy corrupted
and enfeebled to the last degree by an endless succession of
borrowings and intermixtures, lay prostrate under the iron heel
of Rome. Then appeared among the now obscure remnant of Israel,
one who announced himself as the Prophet like unto Moses,
promised of old; but a prophet whose mission it was to redeem not
Israel only, but the whole world, and to make all who will
believe, children of faithful Abraham. Adopting the whole of the
sacred literature of the Hebrews, and proving his mission by its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
words, he sent forth a few plain men to write its closing books,
and to plant it on the ruins of all the time-honored beliefs of
the nations&mdash;beliefs supported by a splendid and highly organized
priestly system and by despotic power, and gilded by all the
highest efforts of poetry and art.</p>

<p>The story is a very familiar one; but it is marvellous beyond all
others. Nor is the modern history of the Bible less wonderful.
Exhumed from the rubbish of the Middle Ages, it has entered on a
new career of victory. It has stimulated the mind of modern
Europe to all its highest efforts, and has been the charter of
its civil and religious liberties. Its wondrous revelation of all
that man most desires to know, in the past, in the present, and
in his future destinies, has gone home to the hearts of men in
all ranks of society and in all countries. In many great nations
it is the only rule of religious faith. In every civilized
country it is the basis of all that is most valuable in religion.
Where it has been withheld from the people, civilization in its
highest aspects has languished, and superstition, priestcraft,
and tyranny have held their ground or have perished under the
assaults of a heartless and inhuman infidelity. Where it has been
a household book, education has necessarily flourished, liberty
has taken root, and the higher nature of man has been developed
to the full. Driven from many other countries by tyrannical
interference with liberty of thought and discussion, or by a
short-sighted ecclesiasticism, it has taken up its special abode
with the greatest commercial nations of our time; and, scattered
by their agency broadcast over the world, it is read by every
nation under heaven in its own tongue, and is slowly but surely
preparing the way for wider and greater changes than any that
have heretofore resulted from its influence. Explain it as we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
may, the Bible is a great literary miracle; and no amount of
inspiration or authority that can be claimed for it is more
strange or incredible than the actual history of the book. Yet no
book has ever thrown itself into so decided antagonism with all
the great forces of evil in the world. Tyranny hates it, because
the Bible so strongly maintains the individual value and rights
of man as man. The spirit of caste dislikes it for the same
reason. Anarchical license, on the other hand, finds nothing but
discouragement in it. Priestcraft gnashes its teeth at it, as the
very embodiment of private judgment in religion, and because it
so scornfully ignores human authority in matters of conscience,
and human intervention between man and his Maker. Skepticism
sneers at it, because it requires faith and humility, and
threatens ruin to the unbeliever. It launches its thunders
against every form of violence or fraud or allurement that seeks
to profit by wrong or to pander to the vices of mankind; all
these consequently are its foes. On the other hand, by its
uncompromising stand with reference to certain scientific and
historical facts, it has appeared to oppose the progress of
thought and speculation; though, as we shall see, it has been
unfairly accused in this last respect.</p>

<p>With its antagonism to the evil that is in the world we have at
present nothing to do, except to caution the student of this
venerable literature against the prejudices which interested and
unscrupulous foes seek to cultivate. Its doctrine of the origin
of man and of the world, and the relation of this to modern
scientific and historical results, is that which now claims our
attention; and this more especially in the relation which the
Mosaic cosmogony, considered as an early revelation from God, may
be found to bear to the facts which modern scientific research
has elicited from the universe itself. The aspects in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
apparent conflicts present themselves are threefold. At one time
it was not unusual to impugn the historical accuracy of the
Pentateuch on the evidence of the Greek historians; and on many
points scarcely any corroborative evidence could be cited in
favor of the Hebrew writers. In our own time much of this
difficulty has been removed, and an immense amount of learned
research has been reduced to waste paper, by the circumstance
that the monuments of Egypt and Assyria have risen up to bear
testimony in favor of the Bible; and scarcely any sane man now
doubts the value of the Hebrew history. The battle-ground has in
consequence been shifted farther back, to points concerning the
affiliation of the races of men, the absolute antiquity of man's
residence on the earth, and the condition of prehistoric men;
questions on which we can scarcely expect to find, at least for a
long time, any decisive monumental or scientific evidence.
Secondly, the Bible commits itself to certain cosmological
doctrines and statements respecting the system of nature, and
details of that system, more or less approaching to the domain
which geology occupies in its investigations of the past history
of the earth; and at every stage in the progress of modern
science, independently of the mischief done by smatterers and
skeptics, earnest bigotry on the one hand, and earnest scientific
enthusiasm on the other, have come into collision. One
stumbling-block after another has, it is true, been removed by
mutual concession and farther enlightenment, and by the removal
of false traditional interpretations of the sacred records, as
well as by farther discoveries in relation to nature. But the
field of conflict has thereby apparently only changed; and we
still have some Christians in consequence regarding the
revelations of natural science with suspicion, and some
scientific men cherishing a sullen resentment against what they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
regard as an intolerant intermeddling of theology with the domain
of legitimate investigation. Lastly, the great growth of physical
science, and the tendency to take partial views of the universe
as if it were comprehended in mere matter and force, with
similarly partial views of the doctrines of continuity and the
conservation of forces, along with the growth of a belief in
spontaneous evolution as a philosophical dogma, have placed many
scientific minds in a position which makes them treat the whole
question of the origin and destiny of man and of the world with
absolute indifference.</p>

<p>There can nevertheless be no question that the whole subject is
at the present moment in a more satisfactory state than ever
previously; that much has been done for the solution of
difficulties; that many theologians admit the great service which
in many cases science has rendered to the interpretation of the
Bible, and that most naturalists feel themselves free from undue
trammels. Above all, there is a very general disposition to admit
the distinctness and independence of the fields of revelation and
natural science, the possibility of their arriving at some of the
same truths, though in very different ways, and the folly of
expecting them fully and manifestly to agree in the present state
of our information. The literature of this kind of natural
history has also become very extensive, and there are few persons
who do not at least know that there are methods of reconciling
the cosmogony of Moses with that obtained from the study of
nature. For this very reason the time is favorable for an
unprejudiced discussion of the questions involved; and for
presenting on the one hand to naturalists a summary of what the
Bible does actually teach respecting the early history of the
earth and man, and on the other to those whose studies lie in the
book which they regard as the Word of God, rather than in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
material universe which they regard as his work, a view of the
points in which the teaching of the Bible comes into contact with
natural science at its present stage of progress. These are the
ends which I propose to myself in the following pages, and which
I shall endeavor to pursue in a spirit of fair and truthful
investigation; having regard on the one hand to the claims and
influence of the venerable Book of God, and on the other to the
rights and legitimate results of modern scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>The plan which I have proposed to myself in this part of my
subject is to take the statements of Genesis in their order, and
consider what they import, and how they appear to harmonize with
what we know from other sources. This will occupy some space, but
it will save time in dealing with the remaining parts of the
subject. Before entering upon it, I propose to devote one chapter
to the answers to three questions which concern the whole
doctrine of revealed religion, whether Semitic, Turanian, or
Aryan. These are: (1) <i>Why</i> the origin of things should be
revealed; (2) <i>How</i> it could be revealed; and (3) <i>What</i> would
require to be revealed in order to form the basis of a rational
theism.</p>

<span style="font-size:70%;">OBJECTS AND NATURE OF A REVELATION OF ORIGINS.</span><br /></h2>


<p style="font-size:80%;font-weight:bold;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
"There are two books from which I collect my divinity;
besides that written one of God, another of his servant
nature&mdash;that universal and public manuscript that lies
expansed unto the eyes of all."&mdash;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir T. Browne.</span></p>


<p>There are some questions, simple enough in themselves, respecting
the general character and object of the references to nature and
creation in the Scriptures, which yet are so variously and
vaguely answered that they deserve some consideration before
entering on the detailed study of the subject. These are: (1) The
object of the introduction of such subjects into the Hebrew
sacred books&mdash;the <i>why</i> of the revelation of origins. (2) The
origin, character, and structure of the narrative of creation and
other cosmological statements in those books&mdash;the <i>how</i> of the
revelation. (3) The character of the Biblical cosmogony, and
general views of nature to which it leads&mdash;the <i>what</i> of the
revelation.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Object of the Introduction of a Cosmogony in the
Bible.</i>&mdash;Man, even in his rudest and most uncivilized state, does
not limit his mental vision to his daily wants. He desires to
live not merely in the present, but in the future also and the
past. This is a psychological peculiarity which, as much as any
other, marks his separation from the lower animals, and which in
his utmost degradation he never wholly loses. Whatever may be
fancied as to imagined prehistoric nations, it is certain that no
people now existing, or historically known to us, is so rude as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
to be destitute of some hopes or fears in reference to the
future, some traditions as to the distant past. Every religious
system that has had any influence over the human mind has
included such ideas. Nor are we to regard this as an accident. It
depends on fixed principles in our constitution, which crave as
their proper aliment such information; and if it can not be
obtained, the mind, rather than want it, invents for itself. We
might infer from this very circumstance that a true religion,
emanating from the Creator, would supply this craving; and might
content ourselves with affirming that, on this ground alone, it
behooved revelation to have a cosmogony.</p>

<p>But the religion of the Hebrews especially required to be
explicit as to the origin of the earth and all things therein.
Its peculiar dogma is that of one only God, the Creator,
requiring the sole homage of his creatures. The heathen for the
most part acknowledged in some form a supreme god, but they also
gave divine honors to subordinate gods, to deceased ancestors and
heroes, and to natural phenomena, in such a manner as practically
to obscure their ideas of the Creator, or altogether to set aside
his worship. The influence of such idolatry was the chief
antagonism which the Hebrew monotheism had to encounter; and we
learn from the history of the nation how often the worshippers of
Jehovah were led astray by its allurements. To guard against this
danger, it was absolutely necessary that no place should be left
for the introduction of polytheism, by placing the whole work of
creation and providence under the sole jurisdiction of the One
God. Moses consequently takes strong ground on these points. He
first insists on the creation of all things by the fiat of the
Supreme. Next he specifies the elaboration and arrangement of all
the powers of inanimate nature, and the introduction of every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
form of organic existence, as the work of the same First Cause.
Lastly, he insists on the creation of a primal human pair, and on
the descent from them of all the branches of the human race,
including of course those ancestors and magnates who up to his
time had been honored with apotheosis; and on the same principle
he explains the golden age of Eden, the fall, the cherubic
emblems, the deluge, and other facts in human history interwoven
by the heathen with their idolatries. He thus grasps the whole
material of ancient idolatry, reduces it within the compass of
monotheism, and shows its relation to the one true primitive
religion, which was that not only of the Hebrews, but of right
that of the whole world, whose prevailing polytheism consisted in
perversions of its truth or unity. For such reasons the early
chapters of Genesis are so far from being of the character of
digressions from the scope and intention of the book, that they
form a substratum of doctrine absolutely essential to the Hebrew
faith, and equally so to its development in Christianity.</p>

<p>The references to nature in the Bible, however, and especially in
its poetical books, far exceed the absolute requirements of the
reasons above stated; and this leads to another and very
interesting view, namely, the tendency of monotheism to the
development of truthful and exalted ideas of nature. The Hebrew
theology allowed no attempt at visible representations of the
Creator or of his works for purposes of worship. It thus to a
great extent prevented that connection of imitative art with
religion which flourished in heathen antiquity, and has been
introduced into certain forms of Christianity. But it cultivated
the higher arts of poetry and song, and taught them to draw their
inspiration from nature as the only visible revelation of Deity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Hence the growth of a healthy "physico-theology," excluding all
idolatry of natural phenomena, and all superstitious dread of
them as independent powers, but inviting to their examination as
manifestations of God, and leading to conceptions of the unity of
plan in the cosmos, of which polytheism, even in its highest
literary efforts, was quite incapable. In the same manner the
Bible has always proved itself an active stimulant of natural
science, connecting such studies, as it does, with our higher
religious sentiments; while polytheism and materialism have acted
as repressive influences, the one because it obscures the unity
of nature, the other because, in robbing it of its presiding
Divinity, it gives a cold and repulsive, corpse-like aspect,
chilling to the imagination, and incapable of attracting the
general mind.</p>

<p>Naturalists should not forget their obligations to the Bible in
this respect, and should on this very ground prefer its teachings
to those of modern pantheism and positivism, and still more to
those of mere priestly authority. Very few minds are content with
simple materialism, and those who must have a God, if they do not
recognize the Jehovah of the Hebrew Scriptures as the Creator and
Supreme Ruler of the universe, are too likely to seek for him in
the dimness of human authority and tradition, or of pantheistic
philosophy; both of them more akin to ancient heathenism than to
modern civilization, and in their ultimate tendencies, if not in
their immediate consequences, quite as hostile to progress in
science as to evangelical Christianity.</p>

<p>Every student of human nature is aware of the influence in favor
of the appreciation of natural beauty and sublimity which the
Bible impresses on those who are deeply imbued with its teaching;
even where that same teaching has induced what may be regarded as
a puritanical dislike of imitative art, at least in its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
religious aspects. On the other hand, naturalists can not refuse
to acknowledge the surpassing majesty of the views of nature
presented in the Bible. No one has expressed this better than
Humboldt: "It is characteristic of the poetry of the Hebrews
that, as a reflex of monotheism, it always embraces the universe
in its unity, comprising both terrestrial life and the luminous
realms of space; it dwells but rarely on the individuality of
phenomena, preferring the contemplation of great masses. The
Hebrew poet does not depict nature as a self-dependent object,
glorious in its individual beauty, but always as in relation or
subjection to a higher spiritual power. Nature is to him a work
of creation and order&mdash;the living expression of the omnipresence
of the Divinity in the visible world." In reference to the 104th
Psalm, which may be viewed as a poetical version of the narrative
of creation in Genesis, the same great writer remarks: "We are
astonished to find in a lyrical poem of such a limited compass,
the whole universe&mdash;the heavens and the earth&mdash;sketched with a
few bold touches. The calm and toilsome life of man, from the
rising of the sun to the setting of the same, when his daily work
is done, is here contrasted with the moving life of the elements
of nature. This contrast and generalization in the conception of
the mutual action of natural phenomena, and the retrospection of
an omnipresent invisible Power, which can renew the earth or
crumble it to dust, constitute a solemn and exalted rather than a
gentle form of poetic creation."
<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>If we admit the source of inspiration claimed by the Hebrew
poets, we shall not be surprised that they should thus write of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
nature. We shall only lament that so many pious and learned
interpreters of Scripture have been too little acquainted with
nature to appreciate the natural history of the Book of God, or
adequately to illustrate it to those who depend on their
teaching; and that so many naturalists have contented themselves
with wondering at the large general views of the Hebrew poets,
without considering that they are based on a revelation of the
nature and order of the creative work which supplied to the
Hebrew mind the place of those geological wonders which have
astonished and enlarged the minds of modern nations. A modern
divine, himself well read in nature, truly says: "If men of piety
were also men of science, and if men of science were to read the
Scriptures, there would be more faith on the earth and also more
philosophy."
<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
 In a similar strain the patient botanist of the
marine alg&aelig; thus pleads for the joint claims of the Bible and
nature: "Unfortunately it happens that in the educational course
prescribed to our divines natural history has no place, for which
reason many are ignorant of the important bearings which the book
of nature has on the book of revelation. They do not consider,
apparently, that both are from God&mdash;both are his faithful
witnesses to mankind. And if this be so, is it reasonable to
suppose that either, without the other, can be fully understood?
It is only necessary to glance at the absurd commentaries in
reference to natural objects which are to be found in too many
annotations of the Holy Scriptures to be convinced of the benefit
which the clergy would themselves derive from a more extended
study of the works of creation. And to missionaries especially, a
minute familiarity with natural objects must be a powerful
assistance in awakening the attention of the savage, who, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
his manner, is a close observer, and likely to detect a fallacy
in his teacher, should the latter attempt a practical
illustration of his discourse without sufficient knowledge. These
are not days in which persons who ought to be our guides in
matters of doctrine can afford to be behind the rest of the world
in knowledge; nor can they safely sneer at the knowledge which
puffeth up, until, like the apostle, they have sounded its depths
and proved its shallowness."
<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
 It is truly much to be desired
that divines and commentators, instead of trying to distort the
representations of nature in the Bible into the supposed
requirements of a barbarous age, or of setting aside modern
discoveries as if they could have no connection with Scripture
truth, would study natural objects and laws sufficiently to bring
themselves in this respect to the level of the Hebrew writers.
Such knowledge would be cheaply purchased even by the sacrifice
of a part of their verbal and literary training. It is well that
this point is now attracting the attention of the Christian
world, and it is but just to admit that some of our more eminent
religious writers have produced noble examples of accurate
illustrations of Scripture derived from nature. In any case, the
Bible itself can not be charged with any neglect of the claims of
nature or with any narrow tendency to place material and
spiritual things in antagonism to one another.</p>

<p>Another reason why a revelation from God must deal with the
origins of things, is that such revelation is, like creation, in
its own nature progressive. It is given little by little to
successive generations of men, and must proceed from the first
rudiments of religious truth onward to its higher developments
with the growth of humanity from age to age. Hence the teachings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in the early chapters of Genesis are of the simplest and most
child-like character, and the first of these early teachings is
necessarily that of God the Creator, just as our elementary
catechisms for children have been wont to begin with the
question, "Who made you?" In this way man is led in the most
direct and simple way to the feet of the Universal Father, and a
foundation is laid whereon further religious teaching adapted to
the growth of the individual mind and to the growing
complications of human society can be built. But again, alike in
the earliest and simplest as in the more advanced states of the
human mind, if spiritual things are to be taught, it must be
through the medium of material things. We have no language to
express in any direct way spiritual truths; they must be given to
us in terms of the natural. We have not yet learned the tongue of
the immortals, and probably can not learn it in this world. The
word "spirit" itself, which we borrow from the Latin, the Greek
<i>Pneuma</i>, the Hebrew <i>Ruah</i>, primarily all agree in signifying
breath or wind. We have to speak of our own breath when we mean
our spiritual nature, of God's breath when we mean his spiritual
nature, and so of all other things not obvious to our senses.
There is constant danger in this that the material shall be taken
for the spiritual of which it is the symbol, the figure for the
reality, the creature for the Creator, and this danger is best
counteracted by a decided testimony in relation to the origin of
all material things in the will of the spiritual and eternal God.
Thus the Bible writers are enabled to use a free and bold manner
of speech respecting divine things. Their expressions at one time
appear pantheistic and at another anthropomorphic; they see God
in every thing, and use with the utmost freedom natural emblems
to indicate his perfections and procedure, and our relations to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
him. In this way there is life and action in their teaching, and
it is removed as far as possible from a dry, abstract theology,
while equally remote from any tinge of idolatry or superstition.</p>

<p>It may, however, be objected that by the introduction of a
cosmogony the Bible exposes itself to a conflict with science,
and that thereby injury results both to science and to religion.
This is a grave charge, and one that has evidently had much
weight with many minds, since it has been the subject of entire
treatises designed to illustrate the history of the conflict or
to explain its nature. The revelation of God's will to man for
his moral guidance, if necessary at all, was necessary before the
rise of natural science. Men could not do without the knowledge
of the unity of nature and of the unity of God, until these great
truths could be worked out by scientific induction. Perhaps they
might never have been so worked out. Therefore a revealed book of
origins has a right to precedence in this matter. Nor need it in
any way come into conflict with the science subsequently to grow
up. Science does not deal so much with the origin of nature as
with its method and laws, and all that is necessary on the part
of a revelation, to avoid conflict with it, is to confine itself
to statements of phenomena and to avoid hypotheses. This is
eminently the course of the Bible. In its cosmogony it shuns all
embellishments and details, and contents itself with the fact of
creation and a slight sketch of its order; and in their
subsequent references to nature the sacred writers are strictly
phenomenal in their statements, and refer every thing directly to
the will of God, without any theory as to secondary causes and
relations. They are thus decided and positive on the points with
reference to which it behooves revelation to testify, and
absolutely non-committal on the points which belong to the
exclusive domain of science.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
What, then, are we to say of the imaginary "conflict of science
with religion," of which so much has been made? Simply that it
results largely from misapprehension and from misuse of terms.
True religion, which consists in practical love to God and to our
fellow-men, can have no conflict with science. True science is
its fast ally. The Bible, considered as a revelation of spiritual
truth to man for his salvation and enlightenment, can have no
conflict with science. It promotes the study of nature, rendering
it honorable by giving it the dignity of an inquiry into the ways
of God, and rendering it safe by separating it from all ideas of
magic and necromancy. It gives a theological basis to the ideas
of the unity of nature and of natural law. The conflict of
science, when historically analyzed, is found to have been
fourfold&mdash;with the Church, with theology, with superstition, and
with false or imperfect science and philosophy. Religious men may
have identified themselves from time to time with these
opponents, but that is all; and much more frequently the
opposition has been by bad men more or less professing religious
objects. Organizations calling themselves "the Church," and whose
warrant from the Bible is often of the slenderest, have denounced
and opposed and persecuted new scientific truths; but they have
just as often denounced the Bible itself, and religious doctrines
founded on it. Theology claims to be itself one of the sciences,
and as such it is necessarily imperfect and progressive, and may
at any time be more or less in conflict with other sciences; but
theology is not religion, and may often have very little in
common either with true religion or the Bible. When discussions
arise between theology and other sciences, it is only a pity that
either side should indulge in what has been called the <i>odium
theologicum</i>, but which is unfortunately not confined to divines.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Superstition, considered as the unreasonable fear of natural
agencies, is a passive rather than an active opponent of science.
But revelation, which affirms unity, law, and a Father's hand in
nature, is the deadly foe of superstition, and no people who have
been readers of the Bible and imbued with its spirit have ever
been found ready to molest or persecute science. Work of this
sort has been done only by the ignorant, superstitious, and
priest-ridden votaries of systems which withhold the Bible from
the people, and detest it as much as they dislike science.
Perhaps the most troublesome opposition to science, or rather to
the progress of science, has sprung from the tenacity with which
men hold to old ideas. These, which may have been at one time the
best science attainable, root themselves in popular literature,
and even in learned bodies and in educational books and
institutions. They become identified with men's conceptions both
of nature and religion, and modify their interpretations of the
Bible itself. It thus becomes a most difficult matter to wrench
them from men's minds, and their advocates are too apt to invoke
in their defense political, social, and ecclesiastical powers,
and to seek to support them by the authority of revelation, when
this may perhaps be quite as favorable to the newer views opposed
to them. All these conflicts are, however, necessary incidents in
human progress, which comes only by conflict; and there is reason
to believe that they would be as severe in the absence of
revealed religion as in its presence, were it not that the
absence of revelation seems often to produce a fixity and
stagnation of thought unfavorable to any new views, and
consequently to some extent to any intellectual conflict. It has
been, indeed, to the disinterment of the Bible in the Reformation
of the fifteenth century that the world owes, more than to any
other cause, the immense growth of modern science, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
freedom of discussion which now prevails. The Protestant idea of
individual judgment in matters of religion is thoroughly
Biblical, for the Bible everywhere appeals to men in this way;
and this idea is the strongest guarantee that the world possesses
for intellectual liberty in other matters.</p>

<p>We conclude, therefore, on all these grounds, that it was
necessary that a revelation from God should take strong and
positive ground on the question of the origin of the universe.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Origin, Method, and Structure of the Scriptural
Cosmogony.</i>&mdash;A respectable physicist, but somewhat shallow
naturalist and theologian, whose works at one time attracted much
attention, has said of the first chapter of Genesis: "It can not
be history&mdash;it may be poetry." Its claims to be history we shall
investigate under another head, but it is pertinent to our
present inquiry to ask whether it can be poetry. That its
substance or matter is poetical no one who has read it once can
believe; but it can not be denied that in its form it approaches
somewhat to that kind of thought-rhythm or parallelism which
gives so peculiar a character to Hebrew poetry. We learn from
many Scripture passages, especially in the Proverbs, that this
poetical parallelism need not necessarily be connected with
poetical thought; that in truth it might be used, as rhyme is
sometimes with us, to aid the memory. The oldest acknowledged
verse in Scripture is a case in point. Lamech, who lived before
the flood, appears to have slain a man in self-defense, or at
least in an encounter in which he himself was wounded; and he
attempts to define the nature of the crime in the following
words:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;<br />
Ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech:&mdash;<br />

I have slain a man to my wounding,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
And a young man to my hurt;<br />
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,<br />
Truly Lamech seventy and seven fold."</p>

<p>All this is prosaic enough in matter, but the form into which it
is thrown gives it a certain dignity, and impresses it on the
memory; which last object was probably what the author of this
sole fragment of antediluvian literature had in view. He
succeeded too&mdash;for the sentiment was handed down, probably
orally; and Moses incorporates it in his narration, perhaps on
account of its interest as the first record of the distinction
between willful murder like that of Cain, and justifiable
homicide. It is interesting also to observe the same parallelism
of style, no doubt with the same objects, in many old Egyptian
monumental inscriptions, which, however grandiloquent, are
scarcely poetical.
<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
 It also appears in that ancient record of
creation and the deluge recently rescued from the clay tablets of
Nineveh.</p>

<p>Now in the first chapter of Genesis, and the first three verses
of chapter second, being the formal general narrative of
creation, on which, as we shall see, every other statement on the
subject in the Bible is based, we have this peculiar parallelism
of style. If we ask why, the answer must, I think, be&mdash;to give
dignity and symmetry to what would otherwise be a dry abstract,
and still more to aid memory. This last consideration, perhaps
indicating that this chapter, like the apology of Lamech, had
been handed down orally for a long period, connects itself with
the theory of the pre-Abrahamic origin of these documents to
which reference has already been made.</p>

<p>The form of the narrative, however, in no way impairs its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
precision or accuracy of statement. On this Eichhorn well says:
"There lies at the foundation of the first chapter a carefully
designed plan, all whose parts are carried out with much art,
whereby its appropriate place is assigned to every idea;" and we
may add, whereby every idea is expressed in the simplest and
fewest words, yet with marvellous accuracy, amounting to an
almost scientific precision of diction, for which both the form
into which it is thrown and the homogeneous and simple character
of the Hebrew language are very well adapted. Much of this indeed
remains in the English version, though our language is less
perfectly suited than the Hebrew for the concise announcement of
general truths of this description. Our translators have,
however, deviated greatly from the true sense of many important
words, especially where they have taken the Septuagint
translation for their guide, as in the words "firmament,"
"whales," "creeping things," etc. These errors will be noticed in
subsequent pages. In the mean time I may merely add that the
labors of the ablest Biblical critics give us every reason to
conclude that the received text of Genesis preserves, almost
without an iota of change, the beautiful simplicity of its first
chapter; and that we now have it in a more perfect state than
that in which it was presented to the translators of most of the
early versions. It must also be admitted that the object in view
was best served by that direct reference to the creative fiat,
and ignoring of all secondary causes, which are conspicuous in
this narrative. This is indeed the general tone of the Bible in
speaking of natural phenomena; and this mode of proceeding is in
perfect harmony with its claims to divine authority. Had not this
course been chosen, no other could have been adopted, in strict
consistency with truth, short of a full revelation of the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
system of nature, in the details of all its laws and processes.
This we now know would have been impossible, and, if possible,
useless or even mischievous.</p>

<p>Regarded from this point of view&mdash;the plenary inspiration of the
book&mdash;the Scriptural references to creation profess to furnish a
very general outline, for theological purposes, of the principal
features of a vast region unexplored when they were written, and
into which human research has yet penetrated along only a few
lines. Natural science, in following out these lines of
observation, has reached some of the objects delineated in the
Scriptural sketch; of others it has obtained distant glimpses;
many are probably unknown, and we can appreciate the true value
and dimensions relatively to the whole of very few. So vast
indeed are the subjects of the bold sketch of the Hebrew prophet,
that natural science can not pretend as yet so to fill in the
outline as quite to measure the accuracy of its proportions. Yet
the lines, though few, are so boldly drawn, and with so much
apparent unity and symmetry, that we almost involuntarily admit
that they are accurate and complete. This may appear to be
underrating the actual progress of science relatively to this
great foreshadowing outline; but I know that those most deeply
versed in the knowledge of nature will be the least disposed to
quarrel with it, whatever skepticism they may entertain as to the
greater general completeness of the inspired record.</p>

<p>Another point which deserves a passing notice here is the theory
of Dr. Kurtz and others, that the Mosaic narrative represents a
vision of creation, analogous to those prophetic visions which
appear in the later books of Scripture. This is beyond all
question the most simple and probable solution of the origin of
the document, when viewed as inspired, but we shall have to recur
to it on a future page.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
But with respect to the precise origin of this cosmogony, the
question now arises, Is it really in substance a revelation from
God to man? We must not disguise from ourselves that this
deliberate statement of an order of creation in so far challenges
comparison with the results of science, and this in a very
different way from that which applies to the incidental
references to nature in the Bible. Further, inasmuch as it
relates to events which transpired before the creation of man, it
is of the nature of prophecy rather than of history. It is, in
short, either an inspired revelation of the divine procedure in
creation, or it is a product of human imagination or research, or
a deliberate fraud.</p>

<p>To no part of the Bible do these alternatives more strictly apply
than to its first chapter. This "can not be history" in the
strict acceptation of the term. It relates to events which no
human eye witnessed, respecting which no human testimony could
give any information. It represents the creation of man as the
last of a long series of events, of which it professes to inform
us. The knowledge of these events can not have been a matter of
human experience. If at all entitled to confidence, the narrative
must, therefore, be received as an inspired document, not handed
down by any doubtful tradition, but existing as originally
transfused into human language from the mind of the Author of
nature himself. This view is in no way affected by the
hypothesis, already mentioned, that the first chapters of Genesis
were compiled by Moses from more ancient documents. This merely
throws back the revelation to a higher antiquity, and requires us
to suppose the agency of two inspired men instead of one.</p>

<p>It would be out of place here to enter into any argument for the
inspiration of Scripture, or to attempt to define the nature of
that inspiration. I merely wish to impress on the mind of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
reader that without the admission of its reality, or at least its
possibility, our present inquiry becomes merely a matter of
curious antiquarian research. We must also on this ground
distinguish between the claims of the Scriptures and those of
tradition or secular history, when they refer to the same facts.
The traditions and cosmogonies of some ancient nations have many
features in common with the Bible narrative; and, on the
supposition that Moses compiled from older documents, they may be
portions of this more ancient sacred truth, but clothed in the
varied garments of the fanciful mythological creeds which have
sprung up in later and more degenerate times. Such fragments may
safely be received as secondary aids to the understanding of the
authentic record, but it would be folly to seek in them for the
whole truth. They are but the scattered masses of ore, by tracing
which we may sometimes open up new and rich portions of the vein
of primitive lore from which they have been derived. It is,
however, quite necessary here formally to inquire if there are
any hypotheses short of that of plenary inspiration which may
allow us to attach any value whatever to this most ancient
document. I know but two views of this kind that are worthy of
any attention.</p>

<p>1. The Mosaic account of creation may be a result of ancient
scientific inquiries, analogous to those of modern geology.</p>

<p>2. It may be an allegorical or poetical mythus, not intended to
be historical, but either devised for some extraneous purpose, or
consisting of the conjectures of some gifted intellect.</p>

<p>These alternatives we may shortly consider, though the materials
for their full discussion can be furnished only by facts to be
subsequently stated. I am not aware that the first of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
views has been maintained by any modern writer. Some eminent
scientific men are, however, disposed to adopt such an
explanation of the ancient Hindoo hymns, as well as of the
cosmogony of Pythagoras, which bears evidence of this origin; and
it may be an easy step to infer that the Hebrew cosmogony was
derived from some similar source. Not many years ago such a
supposition would have been regarded as almost insane. Then the
science of antiquity was only another name for the philosophy of
Greece and Rome. But in recent times we have seen Egypt disclose
the ruins of a mighty civilization, more grand and massive though
less elegant than that of Greece, and which had reached its acme
ere Greece had received its alphabet&mdash;a civilization which,
according to the Scripture history, is derived from that of the
primeval Cushite empire, which extended from the plains of Shinar
over all Southeastern Asia, but was crushed at its centre before
the dawn of secular history. We have now little reason to doubt
that Moses, when he studied the learning of Egypt, held converse
with men who saw more clearly and deeply into nature's mysteries
than did Thales or Pythagoras, or even Aristotle.
<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
 Still later
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the remnants of old Nineveh have been exhumed from their long
sepulture, and antiquaries have been astonished by the discovery
that knowledge and arts, supposed to belong exclusively to far
more recent times, were in the days of the early Hebrew kings,
and probably very long previously, firmly established on the
banks of the Tigris. Such discoveries, when compared with hints
furnished by the Scriptures, tend greatly to exalt our ideas of
the state of civilization at the time when they were written; and
we shall perceive, in the course of our inquiry, many additional
reasons for believing that the ancient Israelites were much
farther advanced in natural science than is commonly supposed.</p>

<p>We have, however, no positive proof of such a theory, and it is
subject to many grave objections. The narrative itself makes no
pretension to a scientific origin, it quotes no authority, and it
is connected with no philosophical speculations or deductions. It
bears no internal evidence of having been the result of inductive
inquiry, but appeals at once to faith in the truth of the great
ultimate doctrine of absolute creation, and then proceeds to
detail the steps of the process, in the manner of history as
recorded by a witness, and not in the manner of science tracing
back effects to their causes. Farther, it refers to conditions of
our planet respecting which science has even now attained to no
conclusions supported by evidence, and is not in a position to
make dogmatic assertions. The tone of all the ancient cosmogonies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
has in these respects a resemblance to that of the Scriptures,
and bears testimony to a general impression pervading the mind of
antiquity that there was a divine and authoritative testimony to
the facts of creation, distinct from history, philosophical
speculation, or induction.</p>

<p>One of the boldest and simplest methods of this kind is that
followed by the authors of the "Types of Mankind," in the attempt
to assign a purely human origin to Genesis 1st. These writers
admit the greater antiquity of the first chapter, though
assigning the whole of the book to a comparatively modern date.
They say:</p>

<p>"The 'document Jehovah'
<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
 does not especially concern our
present subject; and it is incomparable with the grander
conception of the more ancient and unknown writer of Genesis 1st.
With extreme felicity of diction and conciseness of plan, the
latter has defined the most philosophical views of antiquity upon
<i>cosmogony</i>; in fact so well that it has required the
pal&aelig;ontological discoveries of the nineteenth century&mdash;at least
2500 years after his death&mdash;to overthrow his <i>septenary</i>
arrangement of 'Creation;' which, after all, would still be
correct enough in great principles, were it not for one
individual oversight and one unlucky blunder; not exposed,
however, until long after his era, by post-Copernican astronomy.
The oversight is where he wrote (Gen. i. 6-8), 'Let there be
<i>raqui&ecirc;</i>,' <i>i. e.</i>, a <i>firmament</i>; which proves that his notions
of 'sky' (solid like the concavity of a copper basin, with
<i>stars</i> set as brilliants in the metal) were the same as those of
adjacent people of his time&mdash;indeed, of all men before the
publication of Newton's 'Principia' and of Laplace's 'M&eacute;canique
C&eacute;leste.' The blunder is where he conceives that <i>aur</i>, 'light,'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and <i>iom</i>, 'day' (Gen. i. 14-18), could have been physically
possible <i>three whole days</i> before the 'two great luminaries,'
<i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>, were created. These venial errors deducted, his
majestic song beautifully illustrates the simple process of
ratiocination through which&mdash;often without the slightest
historical proof of intercourse&mdash;different 'Types of Mankind,' at
distinct epochas, and in countries widely apart, had arrived,
naturally, at cosmogonic conclusions similar to the doctrines of
that Hebraical school of which his harmonic and melodious numbers
remain a magnificent memento.</p>

<p>"That process seems to have been the following: The ancients
knew, as we do, that man <i>is</i> upon the earth; and they were
persuaded, as we are, that his appearance was preceded by
unfathomable depths of time. Unable (as we are still) to measure
periods antecedent to man by any <i>chronological</i> standard, the
ancients rationally reached the tabulation of some events
anterior to man through <i>induction</i>&mdash;a method not original with
Lord Bacon, because known to St. Paul; 'for his unseen things
from the creation of the world, his power and Godhead, are
clearly seen, <i>being understood by the things that are made</i>'
(Rom. i., 20). Man, they felt, could not have lived upon earth
without <i>animal</i> food; ergo, 'cattle' preceded him, together with
birds, reptiles, fishes, etc. Nothing living, they knew, could
have existed without light and heat; ergo, the <i>solar system</i>
antedated animal life, no less than the <i>vegetation</i>
indispensable for animal support. But terrestrial plants can not
grow without <i>earth</i>; ergo, that dry land had to be separated
from pre-existent 'waters.' Their geological speculations
inclining rather to the <i>Neptunian</i> than to the <i>Plutonian</i>
theory&mdash;for Werner ever preceded Hutton&mdash;the ancients found it
difficult to 'divide the waters from the waters' without
interposing a metallic substance that 'divided the waters which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
were <i>under</i> the firmament from the waters that were <i>above</i> the
firmament;' so they inferred, logically, that a <i>firmament</i> must
have been actually created for this object. [<i>E.g.</i>, 'The
<i>windows</i> of the skies' (Gen. vii., 11); 'the waters <i>above</i> the
skies' (Psa. cxlviii., 4).] Before the 'waters' (and here is the
peculiar error of the genesiacal bard) some of the ancients
claimed the pre-existence of <i>light</i> (a view adopted by the
writer of Genesis 1st); while others asserted that 'chaos'
prevailed. Both schools united, however, in the conviction that
DARKNESS&mdash;<i>Erebus</i>&mdash;anteceded all other <i>created things</i>. What,
said these ancients, can have existed before the 'darkness?' <i>Ens
entium</i>, the CREATOR, was the humbled reply. <i>Elohim</i> is the
Hebrew vocal expression of that climax; to define whose
attributes, save through the phenomena of creation, is an attempt
we leave to others more presumptuous than ourselves."</p>

<p>The problem here set to the "unknown" author of Genesis is a hard
one&mdash;given the one fact that "man is" to find in detail how the
world was formed in a series of preceding ages of vast duration.
Is it possible that such a problem could have been so worked out
as to have endured the test of three thousand years, and the
scrutiny of modern science? But there is an "oversight" in one
detail, and a "blunder" in another. By reference farther on, the
reader will find under the chapters on "Light" and the
"Atmosphere" that the oversight and blunder are those not of the
writer of Genesis, but of the learned American ethnologists in
the nineteenth century; a circumstance which cuts in two ways in
defense of the ancient author so unhappily unknown to his modern
critics.</p>

<p>The second of the alternatives above referred to, the mythical
hypothesis, has been advanced and ably supported, especially on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the continent of Europe, and by such English writers as are
disposed to apply the methods of modern rationalistic criticism
to the Bible. In one of its least objectionable forms it is thus
stated by Professor Powell:</p>

<p>"The narrative, then, of six periods of creation, followed by a
seventh similar period of rest and blessing, was clearly designed
by adaptation to their conceptions to enforce upon the Israelites
the institution of the Sabbath; and in whatever way its details
may be interpreted, it can not be regarded as an <i>historical</i>
statement of the <i>primeval</i> institution of a Sabbath; a
supposition which is indeed on other grounds sufficiently
improbable, though often adopted. * * * If, then, we would avoid
the alternative of being compelled to admit what must amount to
impugning the truth of those portions at least of the Old
Testament, we surely are bound to give fair consideration to the
only suggestion which can set us entirely free from all the
difficulties arising from the geological contradiction which does
and must exist against any conceivable interpretation which
retains the assertion of the historical character of the details
of the narrative, as referring to the distinct transactions of
each of the seven periods. * * * The one great fact couched in
the general assertion that all things were created by the sole
power of one Supreme Being is the whole of the representation to
which an historical character can be assigned. As to the
particular form in which the descriptive narrative is conveyed,
we merely affirm that it can not be history&mdash;it may be
poetry."
<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The general ground on which this view is entertained is the
supposed irreconcilable contradiction between the literal
interpretation of the Mosaic record and the facts of geology.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
The real amount of this difficulty we are not, in the present
stage of our inquiry, prepared to estimate. We can, however,
readily understand that the hypothesis depends on the supposition
that the narrative of creation is posterior in date to the Mosaic
ritual, and that this plain and circumstantial series of
statements is a fable designed to support the Sabbatical
institution, instead of the rite being, as represented in the
Bible itself, a commemoration of the previously recorded fact.
This is, fortunately, a gratuitous assumption, contrary to the
probable date of the documents, as deduced from internal evidence
and from comparison with the Assyrian and other cosmogonies; and
it also completely ignores the other manifest uses mentioned
under our first head. If proved, it would give to the whole the
character of a pious fraud, and would obviously render any
comparison with the geological history of the earth altogether
unnecessary. While, therefore, it must be freely admitted that
the Mosaic narrative can not be history, in so far at least as
history is a product of human experience, we can not admit that
it is a poetical mythus, or, in other words, that it is destitute
of substantial truth, unless proved by good evidence to be so;
and, when this is proved, we must also admit that it is quite
undeserving of the credit which it claims as a revelation from
God.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, the events recorded in the first chapter of
Genesis were not witnessed by man; since there is no reason to
believe that they were discovered by scientific inquiry; and
since, if true, they can not be a poetical myth, we must, in the
mean time, return to our former supposition that the Mosaic
cosmogony is a direct revelation from the Creator. In this
respect, the position of this part of the earth's Biblical
history resembles that of prophecy. Writers <i>may</i> accurately
relate contemporary events, or those which belong to the human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
period, without inspiration; but the moment that they profess
accurately to foretell the history of the future, or to inform us
of events which preceded the human period, we must either believe
them to be inspired, or reject them as impostors or fanatics.
Many attempts have been made to find intermediate
standing-ground, but it is so precarious that the nicest of our
modern critical balancers have been unable to maintain themselves
upon it.</p>

<p>Having thus determined that the Mosaic cosmogony, in its grand
general features, must either be inspired or worthless, we have
further to inquire to what extent it is necessary to suppose that
the particular details and mode of expression of the narrative,
and the subsequent allusions to nature in the Bible, must be
regarded as entitled to this position. We may conceive them to
have been left to the discretion of the writers; and, in that
case, they will merely represent the knowledge of nature actually
existing at the time. On the other hand, their accuracy may have
been secured by the divine afflatus. Few modern writers have been
disposed to insist on the latter alternative, and have rather
assumed that these references and details are accommodated to the
state of knowledge at the time. I must observe here, however,
that a careful consideration of the facts gives to a naturalist a
much higher estimate of the real value of the observations of
nature embodied in the Scriptures than that which divines have
ordinarily entertained; and, consequently, that if we suppose
them of human origin, we must be prepared to modify the views
generally entertained of early Oriental simplicity and ignorance.
The truth is, that a large proportion of the difficulties in
Scriptural natural history appear to have arisen from want of
such accommodation to the low state of the knowledge of nature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
among translators and expositors; and this is precisely what we
should expect in a veritable revelation. Its moral and religious
doctrines were slowly developed, each new light illuminating
previous obscurities. Its human history comes out as evidence of
its truth, when compared with monumental inscriptions; and why
should not the All-wise have constructed as skilfully its
teachings respecting his own works? There can be no doubt
whatever that the Scripture writers intended to address
themselves to the common mind, which now as then requires simple
and popular teaching, but they were under obligation to give
truthful statements; and we need not hesitate to say, with Dr.
Chalmers, in reference to a book making such claims as those of
the Bible: "There is no argument, saving that grounded on the
usages of popular language, which would tempt us to meddle with
the literalities of that ancient and, as appears to us,
authoritative document, any farther than may be required by those
conventionalities of speech which spring from 'optical'
impressions of nature."
<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Attempt as we may to disguise it, any other view is totally
unworthy of the great Ruler of the universe, especially in a
document characterized as emphatically <i>the truth</i>, and in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
moral revelation, in which statements respecting natural objects
need not be inserted, unless they could be rendered at once
truthful and illustrative of the higher objects of the
revelation. The statement often so flippantly made that the Bible
was not intended to teach natural history has no application
here. <i>Spiritual</i> truths are no doubt shadowed forth in the Bible
by material emblems, often but rudely resembling them, because
the nature of human thought and language render this necessary,
not only to the unlearned, but in some degree to all; but this
principle of adaptation can not be applied to plain material
facts. Yet a confusion of these two very distinct cases appears
to prevail almost unaccountably in the minds of many expositors.
They tell us that the Scriptures ascribe bodily members to the
immaterial God, and typify his spiritual procedure by outward
emblems; and this they think analogous to such doctrines as a
solid firmament, a plane earth, and others of a like nature,
which they ascribe to the sacred writers. We shall find that the
writers of the Scriptures had themselves much clearer views, and
that, even in poetical language, they take no such liberties with
truth.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the extent to which this doctrine of
"accommodation" carries us beyond the limits of fair
interpretation, I cite the following passage from one of the
ablest and most judicious writers on the subject:
<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
 "It was the
opinion of the ancients that the earth, at a certain height, was
surrounded by a transparent hollow sphere of solid matter, which
they called the firmament. When rain descended, they supposed
that it was through windows or holes made in the crystalline
curtain suspended in mid-heavens. To these notions the language
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of the Bible is frequently conformed. * * * But the most decisive
example I have to give on this subject is derived from astronomy.
Until the time of Copernicus no opinion respecting natural
phenomena was thought better established than that the earth is
fixed immovably in the centre of the universe, and that the
heavenly bodies move diurnally round it. To sustain this view the
most decisive language of Scripture might be quoted. God is there
said to have '<i>established the foundations of the earth, so that
they could not be removed forever</i>' and the sacred writers
expressly declare that the heavenly bodies <i>arise and set</i>, and
nowhere allude to any proper motion of the earth."</p>

<p>Will it be believed that, with the exception of the poetical
expression, "windows of heaven," and the common forms of speech
relating to sunrise and sunset, the above "decisive" instances of
accommodation have no foundation whatever in the language of
Scripture. The doctrine of the rotation of solid celestial
spheres around the earth belongs to a Greek philosophy which
arose after the Hebrew cosmogony was complete; and though it
occurs in the Septuagint and other ancient versions, it is not
based on the Hebrew original. In truth, we know that those
Grecian philosophers&mdash;of the Ionic and Pythagorean schools&mdash;who
lived nearest the times of the Hebrew writers, and who derived
the elements of their science from Egypt and Western Asia, taught
very different doctrines. How absurd, then, is it thus to fasten
upon the sacred writers, contrary to their own words, the views
of a school of astronomy which probably arose long after their
time, when we know that more accurate ideas prevailed nearer
their epoch. Secondly, though there is some reason for stating
that the "ancients," though certainly not those of Israel,
believed in celestial spheres supporting the heavenly bodies, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
suspect that the doctrine of a solid vault <i>supporting the
clouds</i>, except as a mere poetical or mythological fancy, is a
product of the imagination of the theologians and closet
philosophers of a more modern time. The testimony of men's senses
appears to be in favor of the whole universe revolving around a
plane earth, though the oldest astronomical school with which we
are acquainted suspected that this is an illusion; but the
every-day observation of the most unlettered man who treads the
fields and is wet with the mists and rains must convince him that
there is no <i>sub-nubilar</i> solid sphere. If, therefore, the Bible
had taught such a doctrine, it would have shocked the
common-sense even of the plain husbandmen to whom it was
addressed, and could have found no fit audience except among a
portion of the literati of comparatively modern times. Thirdly,
with respect to the foundations of the earth, I may remark that
in the tenth verse of Genesis there occurs a definition as
precise as that of any lexicon&mdash;"and God called the <i>dry land</i>
earth;" consequently it is but fair to assume that the earth
afterwards spoken of as supported above the waters is the dry
land or continental masses of the earth, and no geologist can
object to the statement that the dry land is supported above the
waters by foundations or pillars.</p>

<p>We shall find in our examination of the document itself that all
the instances of such accommodation which have been cited by
writers on this subject are as baseless as those above referred
to. It is much to be regretted that so many otherwise useful
expositors have either wanted that familiarity with the aspects
of external nature by which all the Hebrew writers are
characterized, or have taken too little pains to ascertain the
actual meaning of the references to creation which they find in
the Bible. I may further remark that if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
such instances of
accommodation could be found in the later poetical books, it
would be extremely unfair to apply them as aids in the
interpretation of the plain, precise, and unadorned statements of
the first chapters of Genesis. There is, however, throughout even
the higher poetry of the Bible, a truthful representation and
high appreciation of nature for which we seek in vain in any
other poetry, and we may fairly trace this in part to the
influence of the cosmogony which appears in its first chapter.
The Hebrew was thus taught to recognize the unity of nature as
the work of an Almighty Intelligence, to regard all its
operations as regulated by his unchanging law or "decree," and to
venerate it as a revelation of his supreme wisdom and goodness.
On this account he was likely to regard careful observation and
representation with as scrupulous attention as the modern
naturalist. Nor must we forget that the Old Testament literature
has descended to us through two dark ages&mdash;that of Greek and
Roman polytheism and of Middle Age barbarism&mdash;and that we must
not confound its tenets with those of either. The religious ideas
of both these ages were favorable to certain forms of literature
and art, but eminently unfavorable to the successful prosecution
of the study of nature. Hence we have a right to expect in the
literature of the golden age of primeval monotheism more affinity
with the ideas of modern science than in any intermediate time;
and the truthful delineation which the claims of the Bible to
inspiration require might have been, as already hinted, to a
certain extent secured merely by the reflex influence of its
earlier statements, without the necessity of our supposing that
illustrations of this kind in the later books came directly from
the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Our discussion of this part of the subject has necessarily been
rather desultory, and the arguments adduced must depend for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
their full confirmation on the results of our future inquiries.
The conclusions arrived at may be summed up as follows: 1. That
the Mosaic cosmogony must be considered, like the prophecies of
the Bible, to claim the rank of inspired teaching, and must
depend for its authority on the maintenance of that claim. 2.
That the incidental references to nature in other parts of
Scripture indicate, at least, the influence of these earlier
teachings, and of a pure monotheistic faith, in creating a high
and just appreciation of nature among the Hebrew people.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to inquire in what precise form this
remarkable revelation of the origin of the world has been given.
I have already referred to the hypothesis that it represents a
vision of creation presented to the mind of a seer, as if in a
series of pictures which he represents to us in words. This is
perhaps the most intelligible conception of the manner of
communication of a revelation from God; and inasmuch as it is
that referred to in other parts of the Bible as the mode of
presentation of the future to inspired prophets, there can be no
impropriety in supposing it to have been the means of
communicating the knowledge of the unknown past. We may imagine
the seer&mdash;perhaps some aboriginal patriarch, long before the time
of Moses&mdash;perhaps the first man himself&mdash;wrapt in ecstatic
vision, having his senses closed to all the impressions of the
present time, and looking as at a moving procession of the events
of the earth's past history, presented to him in a series of
apparent days and nights. In the first chapter of Genesis he
rehearses this divine vision to us, not in poetry, but in a
series of regularly arranged parts or strophes, thrown into a
sort of rhythmical order fitted to impress them on the memory,
and to allow them to be handed down from mouth to mouth, perhaps
through successive generations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of men, before they could be
fixed in a written form of words. Though the style can scarcely
be called poetical, since its expressions are obviously literal
and unadorned by figures of speech, the production may not
unfairly be called the Song or Ballad of Creation, and it
presents an Archaic simplicity reminding us of the compositions
of the oldest and rudest times, while it has also an artificial
and orderly arrangement, much obscured by its division into
verses and chapters in our Bibles. It is undoubtedly also
characterized by a clearness and grandeur of expression very
striking and majestic, and which shows that it was written by and
intended for men of no mean and contracted minds, but who could
grasp the great problems of the origin of things, and comprehend
and express them in a bold and vigorous manner. It may be well,
before proceeding farther, to present to the reader this ancient
document in a form more literal and intelligible, and probably
nearer to its original dress, than that in which we are most
familiar with it in our English Bibles:</p>

<p>(3) <i>Character of the Biblical Cosmogony, and general Views of
Nature which it Contains or to which it Leads.</i>&mdash;Much of what
appertains to the character of the revelation of origins has been
anticipated under previous heads. We have only to read the Song
of Creation, as given in the last chapter, to understand its
power and influence as a beginning of religious doctrine. The
revelation was written for plain men in the infancy of the world.
Imagine Chaldean or Hebrew shepherd listening to these majestic
lines from the lips of some ancient patriarch, and receiving them
as truly the words of God. What a grand opening to him of both
the seen and unseen worlds! Henceforth he has no superstitious
dread of the stars above, or of the lightning and thunder, or of
the dark woods and flowing waters beneath. They are all the works
of the one Creator, the same Creator who is his own Maker, in
whose image and shadow he is made. He can look up now to the
heavens or around upon the earth, and see in all the handiwork of
God, and can worship God through all. He can see that the power
that cares
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
for the birds and the flowers of the field cares for
him. He is no longer the slave and sport of unknown and dreadful
powers; they are God's workmanship and under his control&mdash;nay,
God has given him a mission to subdue and rule over them. So
these noble words raise him to a new manhood, and emancipate him
from the torture of endless fears, and open to him vast new
fields of thought and inquiry, which may enrich him with
boundless treasures of new religious and intellectual wealth.
Imagine still farther that he wanders into those great cities
which are the seats of the idolatries of his time. He enters
magnificent temples, sees elaborately decorated altars, huge
images, gorgeous ceremonials, priests gay in vestments and
imposing in numbers. He is invited to bow down before the bull
Apis, to worship the statue of Belus or of Ishtar, of Osiris or
of Isis. But this is not in his book of origins. All these things
are contrivances of man, not works of God, and their aim is to
invite him to adore that which is merely his fellow-creature,
that which he has the divine commission to subdue and rule. So
our primitive Puritan turns away. He will rather raise an altar
of rough stones in the desert, and worship the unseen yet real
Creator, the God that has no local habitation in temples made
with hands, yet is everywhere present. Such is the moral
elevation to which this revelation of origins raises humanity;
and when there was added to it the farther history of primeval
innocence, of the fall, and of the promise of a Redeemer, and of
the fate of the godless antediluvians, there was a whole system
of religion, pure and elevating, and placing the Abrahamid&aelig;, who
for ages seem alone to have held to it, on a plane of spiritual
vantage immeasurably above that of other nations. Farther, every
succeeding prophet whose works are included in the sacred canon,
following up these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
doctrines in the same spirit, and added new
treasures of divine knowledge from age to age.</p>

<p>But admitting all this, it may be asked, Are these ancient
records of any value to us? May we not now dispense with them,
and trust to the light of science? The infinitely varied and
discordant notions of our modern literature on these great
questions of origin, the incapacity of any philosophical system
to reach the common mind for practical purposes, and the baseless
character of any religious system which does not build on these
great primitive truths, give a sufficient answer. Farther, we may
affirm that the greatest and widest generalizations of our modern
science have, in so far as they are of practical importance, been
anticipated in the revelations of the Bible, and that in the
cosmogony of Genesis and its continuation in the other sacred
books we have general views of the universe as broad as those of
any philosophies, ancient or modern. This is a hard test for our
revelation, but it can be endured, and we may shortly inquire
what we find in the Bible of such great general truths.</p>

<p>Many may be disposed to admit the accurate delineation of natural
facts open to human observation in the sacred Scriptures, who may
not be prepared to find in these ancient books any general views
akin to those of the ancient philosophers, or to those obtained
by inductive processes in modern times. Yet views of this kind
are scattered through the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, and
are a natural outgrowth and development of the great facts and
principles asserted in the first chapter of Genesis. They resolve
themselves, almost as a matter of course, into the two leading
ideas of order and adaptation. I have already quoted the eloquent
admission by Baron Humboldt of the presence of these ideas of the
cosmos in Psalm civ. They are both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
conspicuous in the narrative
of creation, and equally so in a great number of other passages.
"Order is heaven's first law; and the second is like unto
it&mdash;that every thing serves an end. This is the sum of all
science. These are the two mites, even all that she hath, which
she throws into the treasury of the Lord; and, as she does so in
faith, Eternal Wisdom looks on and approves the deed."
<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
 These two mites, lawfully acquired by science, by her independent
exertions, she may, however, recognize as of the same coinage
with the treasure already laid up in the rich storehouse of the
Hebrew literature; but in a peculiar and complex form, which may
be illustrated under the following general statements:</p>

<p>1. The Scriptures assert invariable natural law, and constantly
recurring cycles in nature. Natural law is expressed as the
ordinance or decree of Jehovah. From the oldest of the Hebrew
books I select the following examples:
<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:15em;">"When he made a decree for the rain,<br />
And a way for the thunder-flash."<br />
<span style="margin-left:10em;">&mdash;Job xxviii., 26.</span><br /><br />

"Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?<br />
Canst thou establish a dominion even over the earth?"<br />
<span style="margin-left:10em;">&mdash;Job xxxviii., 33.</span></p>

<p>The later books give us such views as the following:</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:15em;">"He hath established them [the heavens] for ever and ever;<br />
He hath made a decree which shall not pass."<br />
<span style="margin-left:10em;">&mdash;Psa. cxlviii., 6.</span>
</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:15em;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
"Thou art forever, O Jehovah, thy word is established in the heavens;<br />
Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth;<br />
They continue this day according to thine ordinances, for all are thy servants."<br />
<span style="margin-left:10em;">&mdash;Psa. cxix., 90.</span></p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:15em;">"When he established the clouds above;<br />
When he strengthened the fountains of the deep;<br />
When he gave to the sea his decree,<br />
That the waters should not pass his commandment;<br />
When he appointed the foundations of the earth."<br />
<span style="margin-left:10em;">&mdash;Prov. viii., 28.</span></p>

<p>Many similar instances will be found in succeeding pages; and in
the mean time we may turn to the idea of recurring cycles, which
forms the starting-point of the reasonings of Solomon on the
current of human affairs, in the book of Ecclesiastes: "One
generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the
earth abideth for the ages. The sun ariseth, and the sun goeth
down, and hasteneth to its place whence it arose. The wind goeth
toward the south, and turneth unto the north. It whirleth about
continually, and returneth again according to its circuits. All
the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea doth not overflow; unto
the place whence the rivers came, thither they return again." I
might fill pages with quotations more or less illustrative of the
statement in proof of which the above texts are cited; but enough
has been given to show that the doctrine of the Bible is not that
of fortuitous occurrence, or of materialism, or of pantheism, or
of arbitrary supernaturalism, but of invariable natural law
representing the decree of a wise and unchanging Creator. It is a
common but groundless and shallow charge against the Bible that
it teaches an "arbitrary supernaturalism." What it does teach is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
that all nature is regulated by the laws of God, which like
himself are unchanging, but which are so complex in their
relations and adjustments that they allow of infinite variety,
and do not exclude even miraculous intervention, or what appears
to our limited intelligence as such. In opposition to this, it is
true, some physicists have held that natural law is a fatal
necessity.
<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
 If they mean by this a merely hypothetical
necessity that certain effects must follow if certain laws act,
this is in accordance with the Biblical view, for nothing can
resist the will of God. But if they mean an absolute necessity
that these laws can not be suspended or counteracted by higher
laws, or by the will of the Creator, they assert what is not only
contrary to Scripture, but absurd, for "blind metaphysical
necessity, which is the same always and everywhere, could produce
no variety of things."
<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
 It could lead merely to a dead and
inert equilibrium. On the hypothesis of mere physical necessity,
the universe either never could have existed, or must have come
to an end infinite ages ago, which is the same thing. Only on the
hypothesis of law proceeding from an intelligent will can we
logically account for nature.</p>

<p>2. The Bible recognizes progress and development in nature. At
the very outset we have this idea embodied in the gradual
elaboration of all things in the six creative periods, rising
from the formless void of the beginning, through successive
stages of inorganic and organic being, up to Eden and to man.
Beyond this point the work of creation stops; but there is to be
an occupation and improvement of the whole earth by man spreading
from Eden. This process is arrested or impeded by sin and the
fall. Here commences
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the special province of the Bible, in
explaining the means of recovery from the fall, and of the
establishment of a new spiritual and moral kingdom, and finally
of the restoration of Eden in a new heaven and earth. All this is
moral, and relates to man, in so far as the present state of
things is concerned; but we have the commentary of Jesus: "My
Father worketh hitherto, and I work;" the remarkable statement of
Paul, that the whole creation is involved in the results of man's
moral fall and restoration, and the equally remarkable one that
the Redeemer is also the maker of the "worlds" or ages of the
earth's physical progress, as well as of the future "new heaven
and new earth." Peter also rebukes indignantly those scoffers who
maintained that all things had remained as they are since the
beginning; and refers to the creation week and to the deluge as
earnests of the great changes yet in store for the earth.
<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It is indeed curious to observe how in our version of the Bible
this idea of progress in the universe, or of "time-worlds," as it
has been called, has been variously replaced by the words "world"
and "eternity," owing to the defective ideas prevalent at the
time when the translation was made. In the Hebrew Scriptures the
term <i>Olam</i>, "age," and in the New Testament the equivalent term
<i>Ai[=o]n</i> have been thus treated, and their real significance
much obscured. Thus when it is said, "by faith we understand that
the <i>worlds</i> were framed," or "by him God made the <i>worlds</i>,"
<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
or that certain of God's plans have been hid "from the beginning
of the <i>world</i>,"
<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
 the reference is not to worlds in space, but
to worlds in time, or ages of God's working in the universe. So
also these ages of God's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
working are given to us as our only
intelligible type of eternity, of which absolutely we can have no
conception. Thus God's "eternal purpose" is his purpose of the
ages. So when he is the "King eternal,"
<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
 and in that capacity
gives to his people "life everlasting," he is the King of the
ages, and gives life of the ages. So in the noble hymn attributed
to Moses (Psalm xc.), where our version has, "from everlasting to
everlasting thou art God,"
<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
 the original is, "from age to age
thou art, O God." It has perhaps been a defect of our modern
science that it has familiarized us merely with the existence of
worlds in space, and not with their existence in time. It is only
in comparatively modern times that the developments of
chronological geology and of physical astronomy have brought
before us, not only the long ages in which the earth was passing
through its formative stages, but also the fact that still longer
&aelig;ons are embraced in the history of the other bodies of our solar
system, and of the starry orbs and nebul&aelig;. These grand
conceptions were already embodied in the Hebrew revelation, and
were used there as the means of giving some faint approach to a
conception of the unlimited existence of God himself, of the ages
in which his creative work has been going on, and of the future
life he has prepared for his redeemed people.</p>

<p>Such views of development and progress are not unknown to many
ancient cosmogonies and philosophical systems, but they had no
stable foundation in observed fact until the rise of modern
geology and physical astronomy; which enable us to affirm that,
in addition to those changeless physical laws which cause the
bodies of the universe to wheel in unvarying cycles, and all
natural powers to reproduce themselves, and, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
addition to those organic laws which produce unceasing successions of living
individuals, there is a higher law of progress. We can now trace
back man, the animals and plants his contemporaries, and others
which preceded them, our continents and mountain ranges, and the
solid rocks of which they are composed&mdash;nay, the very fabric of
the solar system itself&mdash;to their several origins at distinct
points of time; and can maintain that since the earth began to
wheel around the sun, no succeeding year has seen it precisely as
it was in the year before. The old Hebrew record affirms, and I
presume scarcely any sane man really doubts, that this law of
progress emanates from the mind and power of one creative Being.
When men see in natural law only recurring cycles, they may be
pardoned for falling even into the absurdity of believing in
eternal succession; but when they see change and progress, and
this in a uniform direction, overmastering recurring cycles, and
introducing new objects and powers not accounted for by previous
objects or powers, they are brought very near to the presence of
the Spiritual Creator. And hence, although no science can reach
back to the act of creation, this doctrine is much more strongly
held in our day by geologists than by physicists. It is quite
true that the idea of creative acts has been superseded to a
great extent by that of "creation by law," or by that of
"evolution." Still behind all there lies a primary creative
power; and the validity of these ideas and their bearing on
theism and creation we shall have to discuss in the sequel. In
one thing only does the Bible here part company with natural
science. The Bible goes on into the future, and predicts a final
condition of our planet, of which science can from its
investigations learn nothing.</p>

<p>3. The Bible recognizes purpose, use, and special adaptation in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
nature. It is, in short, full of natural theology, akin in some
respects to that which has been so elaborately worked out by so
many modern writers. Numerous passages in support of this will
occur to every one who has read the Scriptures. It is necessary
here, however, to direct attention to a distinction very obvious
in Scripture, but not always attended to by writers on this
subject. The Bible maintains the true "final cause" of all nature
to be, not its material and special adaptations or its value to
man, but the pleasure or satisfaction of the Creator himself. In
the earlier periods of Creation, before man was upon the earth,
God contemplates his work and pronounces it good. The heavenly
hosts praise him, saying, "Thou hast created all things, and for
thy pleasure they are and were created." Further, the Bible
represents intelligences higher than man as sharing in the
delight which may be derived from the contemplation of God's
works. When the earth first rose from the waters to greet the
light, "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
shouted for joy." There are many things in nature that strongly
impress the naturalist with this same view, that the Creator
takes pleasure in his works; and, like human genius in its
highest efforts, rejoices in production, even if no sentient
being should be ready to sympathize. The elaborate structures of
fossils, of which we have only fragmentary remains, the profusion
of natural objects of surpassing beauty that grow and perish
unseen by us, the delicate microscopic mechanism of nearly all
organic structures, point to other reasons for beauty and order
than those that concern man, or the mere utilities of human
beings; and though there are now naturalists who deny absolutely
that beauty is an object in nature, and assign even the colors of
flowers and insects to utility alone, and this of a very low
order, this doctrine is so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
repulsive to our higher sentiments
that there is little danger of its general acceptance; while the
slightest consideration shows that the utilities referred to
could have been secured without any of this consummate beauty
associated with them, and our perception of and delight in which
mark in a way beyond the ability of skepticism to cavil at our
own spiritual kinship with the Author of all this profusion of
beauty. Yet man is represented as the chief created being for
whom this earth has been prepared and designed. He obtains
dominion over it. A chosen spot is prepared for him, in which not
only his wants but his tastes are consulted; and, being made in
the image of his Maker, his &aelig;sthetic sentiments correspond with
the beauties of the Maker's work, and he finds there also food
for his reason and imagination. This view of the subject, as well
as others already referred to, is finely represented in the
address of the Almighty to Job.
<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The Bible also very often refers to the special adaptations of
natural objects and laws to each other, and to the promotion of
the happiness of sentient creatures lower than man. The 104th
Psalm is replete with notices of such adaptations, and so is the
address to Job; and indeed this view seems hardly ever absent
from the minds of the Hebrew writers, but has its highest
applications in the lilies of the field, that toil not neither do
they spin, and the sparrows that are sold for a farthing, yet the
heavenly Father has clothed the one with surpassing beauty, and
provides food for the other, nor allows it to fail without his
knowledge. I may, by way of farther illustration, merely name a
few of the adaptations referred to in Job xxxviii. and the
following chapters. The winds and the clouds are so arranged as
to afford the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
required supplies of moisture to the wilderness
where no man is, to "cause the bud of the tender herb to spring
forth." For similar objects the tempest is ordered, and the
clouds arranged "by wisdom." The adaptations of the wild ass, the
wild goat, the ostrich, the migratory birds, the horse, the
hippopotamus, the crocodile, to their several habitats, modes of
life, and uses in nature, are most vividly sketched and applied
as illustrations of the consummate wisdom of the Creator, which
descends to the minutest details of organization and habit.</p>

<p>It is to be observed here that in holding this doctrine of use
and adaptation in nature, the Bible is only consistent with its
own theory of rational theism. The Monotheist can not refer
nature to a conflict of antagonistic powers and forces. He must
recognize in it a unity of plan; and even those things which
appear aberrant, irregular, or noxious must have their place in
this plan. Hence in the Bible God is maker not only of the day
but of the night, not only of the peaceful cattle but of the
voracious crocodile, not only of the sunshine and shower but of
the tornado and the earthquake. Further, in all these things God
is manifested, so that we may learn "his eternal power and
divinity
<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
 from the things which he has made," and in all these
also there are emblems of his relations to us. This argument from
design is in truth the only proof the Bible condescends to urge
for the existence of God; and it is the only one in which in his
later days our great English philosopher Mill could see any
validity.
<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>If the reader happens to be familiar with the objections to the
doctrine of final causes, or teleology, in nature, urged in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
our day by Spencer, Haeckel, and others, he will have seen from the
foregoing statements that these objections are in themselves
baseless, or inapplicable to this doctrine as maintained in the
Bible. There is no consistency in the position of men who, when
they dig a rudely chipped flint out of a bed of gravel,
immediately infer an intelligent workman, and who refuse to see
any indication of a higher intelligence in the creation of the
workman himself. It is a blind philosophy which professes to see
in primal atoms the "promise and potency of mind," and which
fails to perceive that such potency is more inconceivable than
the evidence of primary and supreme mind. The men who maintain
that wings were not planned for flight, but that flight has
produced wings, and thousands of like propositions, are simply
amusing themselves with paradoxes to which may very properly be
applied the strange word devised by Haeckel to express his theory
of nature&mdash;<i>Dysteleology</i>, or purposelessness. It is to be borne
in mind, however, that the teleology of the Bible is not of that
narrow kind which would make man the sole object of nature, and
the supreme judge of its adaptations. Inasmuch as God's plan goes
over all the ages past and future, and relates to the welfare of
all sentient beings known or unknown to us, and also to his own
sovereign pleasure as the supreme object, we may not be in a
position either to understand or profit by all its parts, and
hence may expect to find many mysteries, and many things that we
can not at present reconcile with God's wisdom and goodness. We
know but "parts of his ways," the "fullness of his power who can
understand." "His judgments are unsearchable," "his ways are past
finding out."</p>

<p>4. The law of type or pattern in nature is distinctly indicated
in the Bible. This is a principle only recently understood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
by naturalists, but it has more or less dimly dawned on the minds of
many great thinkers in all ages. Nor is this wonderful, for the
idea of type is scarcely ever absent from our own conceptions of
any work that we may undertake. In any such work we anticipate
recurring daily toil, like the returning cycles of nature. We
look for progress, like that of the growth of the universe. We
study adaptation both of the several parts to subordinate uses,
and of the whole to some general design. But we also keep in view
some pattern, style, or order, according to which the whole is
arranged, and the mutual relations of the parts are adjusted. The
architect must adhere to some order of architecture, and to some
style within that order. The potter, the calico-printer, and the
silversmith must equally study uniformity of pattern in their
several manufactures. The Almighty Worker has exhibited the same
idea in his works. In the animal kingdom, for instance, we have
four or more leading types of structure. Taking any one of
these&mdash;the vertebrate, for example&mdash;we have a uniform general
plan, embracing the vertebral column constructed of the same
elements; the members, whether the arm of man, the limb of the
quadruped, or the wing of the bat or the bird, or the
swimming-paddle of the whale, built of the same bones. In like
manner all the parts of the vertebral column itself in the same
animal, whether in the skull, the neck, or the trunk, are
composed of the same elementary structures. These types are
farther found to be sketched out&mdash;first in their more general,
and then in their special features&mdash;in proceeding from the lower
species of the same type to the higher, in proceeding from the
earlier to the later stages of embryonic development, and in
proceeding from the more ancient to the more recent creatures
that have succeeded each other in geological time. Man, the
highest of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
vertebrates, is thus the archetype, representing
and including all the lower and earlier members of the vertebrate
type. The above are but trite and familiar examples of a doctrine
which may furbish and has furnished the material of volumes.
There can be no question that the Hebrew Bible is the oldest book
in which this principle is stated. In the first chapter of
Genesis we have specific type in the creation of plants and
animals after their kinds or species, and in the formation of man
in the image and likeness of the Creator; and, as we shall find
in the sequel, there are some curious ideas of higher and more
general types in the grouping of the creatures referred to. The
same idea is indicated in the closing chapters of Job, where the
three higher classes of the vertebrates are represented by a
number of examples, and the typical likeness of one of these&mdash;the
hippopotamus&mdash;to man, seems to be recognized. Dr. McCosh has
quoted, as an illustration of the doctrine of types, a very
remarkable passage from Psalm cxxxix.:</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:2em;">"I will praise Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.<br />
Marvellous are thy works,<br />
And that my soul knoweth right well.<br />
My substance was not hid from Thee,<br />
When I was made in secret,<br />
And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth:<br />
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect;<br />
And in thy book all my members were written,<br />
Which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them."</p>

<p>It would too much tax the faith of many to ask them to believe
that the writer of the above passage, or the Spirit that inspired
him, actually meant to teach&mdash;what we now know so well from
geology&mdash;that the prototypes of all the parts of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
archetypal human structure may be found in those fossil remains of extinct
animals which may, in nearly every country, be dug up from the
rocks of the earth. No objection need, however, be taken to our
reading in it the doctrine of embryonic development according to
a systematic type.</p>

<p>Science, it is true, or rather I should perhaps say philosophical
speculation, has sometimes pushed this idea of plan into that of
a spontaneous genetic evolution of things in time, without any
creative superintendence or definite purpose. This way of viewing
the matter is, however, as we shall have occasion to see, both
bald and irrational, and wants the symmetry and completeness of
that style of thought which grasps at once progress and plan and
adaptation, as emanating from a Supreme Will. The question of how
the plan has been worked out will come up for detailed
consideration farther on. In the mean time we have before us the
fact that the Bible represents the cosmos as not the product of a
blind conflict of self-existent forces, but as the result of the
production and guidance of these forces by infinite wisdom.</p>

<p>It is more than curious that this idea of type, so long existing
in an isolated and often depised form, as a theological thought
in the imagery of Scripture, should now be a leading idea of
natural science; and that while comparative anatomy teaches us
that the structures of all past and present lower animals point
to man, who, as Professor Owen expresses it, has had all his
parts and organs "sketched out in anticipation in the inferior
animals," the Bible points still farther forward to an exaltation
of the human type itself into what even the comparative anatomist
might perhaps regard as among the "possible modifications of it
beyond those realized in this little orb of ours," could he but
learn its real nature.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Under the foregoing heads, of the object, the structure, the
authority, and the general cosmical views of the Scripture, I
have endeavored to group certain leading thoughts important as
preliminary to the study of the subject; and, in now entering on
the details of the Old Testament cosmogony, I trust the reader
will pardon me for assuming, as a working hypothesis, that we are
studying an inspired book, revealing the origin of nature, and
presenting accurate pictures of natural facts and broad general
views of the cosmos, at least until in the progress of our
inquiry we find reason to adopt lower views; and that he will, in
the mean time, be content to follow me in that careful and
systematic analysis which a work claiming such a character surely
demands.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">THE BEGINNING.</span><br /><br />

<span style="font-size:50%;">"In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth."&mdash;Genesis i., 1.</span></h2>


<p>It is a remarkable and instructive fact that the first verse of
the Hebrew sacred writings speaks of the material
universe&mdash;speaks of it as a whole, and as originating in a power
outside of itself. The universe, then, in the conception of this
ancient writer, is not eternal. It had a beginning, but that
beginning in the indefinite and by us unmeasured past. It did not
originate fortuitously, or by any merely accidental conflict of
self-existent material atoms, but by an act&mdash;an act of will on
the part of a Being designated by that name which among all the
Semitic peoples represented the ultimate, eternal, inscrutable
source of power and object of awe and veneration. With the
simplicity and child-like faith of an archaic age, the writer
makes no attempt to combat any objections or difficulties with
which this great fundamental truth may be assailed. He feels its
axiomatic force as the basis of all true religion and sound
philosophy, and the ultimate fact which must ever bar our further
progress in the investigation of the origin of things&mdash;the
production from non-existence of the material universe by the
eternal self-existent God.</p>

<p>It did not concern him to know what might be the nature of that
unconditioned self-existence; for though, like our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
ideas of space and time, incomprehensible, it must be assumed. It did not
concern him to know how matter and force subsist, or what may be
the difference between a material universe cognizable by our
senses and the absolute want of all the phenomena of such a
universe or of whatever may be their basis and essence. Such
questions can never be answered, yet the succession of these
phenomena must have had a commencement somewhere in time. How
simple and how grand is his statement! How plain and yet how
profound its teachings!</p>

<p>It is evident that the writer grasps firmly the essence of the
question as to the beginning of things, and covers the whole
ground which advanced scientific or philosophical speculation can
yet traverse. That the universe must have had a beginning no one
now needs to be told. If any philosophical speculator ever truly
held that there has been an endless succession of phenomena,
science has now completely negatived the idea by showing us the
beginning of all things that we know in the present universe, and
by establishing the strongest probabilities that even its
ultimate atoms could not have been eternal. But the question
remains&mdash;If there was a beginning, what existed in that
beginning? To this question many partial and imperfect answers
have been given, but our ancient record includes them all.</p>

<p>If any one should say, "In the beginning was nothing." Yes, says
Genesis, there was, it is true, nothing of the present matter and
arrangements of nature. Yet all was present potentially in the
will of the Creator.</p>

<p>"In the beginning were atoms," says another. Yes, says Genesis,
but they were created; and so says modern science, and must say
of ultimate particles determined by weight and measure, and
incapable of modification in their essential
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
properties&mdash;"They have the properties of a manufactured article."
<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>"In the beginning were forces," says yet another. True, says
Genesis; but all forces are one in origin&mdash;they represent merely
the fiat of the eternal and self-existent. So says science, that
force must in the ultimate resort be an "expression of Will."
<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>"In the beginning was Elohim," adds our old Semitic authority,
and in him are the absolute and eternal thought and will, the
Creator from whom and by whom and in whom are all things.</p>

<p>Thus the simple familiar words, "In the beginning God created the
heaven and the earth," answer all possible questions as to the
origin of things, and include all under the conception of theism.
Let us now look at these pregnant words more particularly as to
their precise import and significance.</p>

<p>The divine personality expressed by the Hebrew Elohim may be
fairly said to include all that can be claimed for the
pantheistic conception of "dynamis," or universal material power.
Lange gives this as included in the term Elohim, in his
discussion of this term in his book on Genesis. It has been aptly
said that if, physically speaking, the fall of a sparrow produces
a gravitative effect that extends throughout the universe, there
can be no reason why it should be unknown to God. God is thus
everywhere, and always. Yet he is everywhere and always present
as a personality knowing and willing. From his thought and will
in the beginning proceeded the universe. By him it was created.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
What, then, is creation in the sense of the Hebrew writer. The
act is expressed by the verb <i>bara</i>, a word of comparatively rare
occurrence in the Scriptures, and employed to denote absolute
creation, though its primary sense is to cut or carve, and it is
indeed a near relative of our own English word "pare." If, says
Professor Stuart, of Andover, this word "does not mean to create
in the highest sense, then the Hebrews had no word by which they
could designate this idea." Yet, like our English "create," the
word is used in secondary and figurative senses, which in no
degree detract from its force when strictly and literally used.
Since, however, these secondary senses may often appear to
obscure the primitive meaning, we must examine them in detail.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of Genesis, after the general statement in
verse 1, other verbs signifying to <i>form</i> or <i>make</i> are used to
denote the elaboration of the separate parts of the universe, and
the word "create" is found in only two places, when it refers to
the introduction of "great whales" (reptiles) and of man. These
uses of the word have been cited to disprove its sense of
absolute creation. It must be observed, however, that in the
first of these cases we have the earliest appearance of animal
life, and in the second the introduction of a rational and
spiritual nature. Nothing but pure materialism can suppose that
the elements of vital and spiritual being were included in the
matter of the heavens and the earth as produced in the beginning;
and as the Scripture writers were not materialists, we may infer
that they recognized, in the introduction of life and reason,
acts of absolute creation, just as in the origin of matter
itself. In Genesis ii. and iii. we have a form of expression
which well marks the distinction between creation and making. God
is there said to have rested from all his works which he "created
and made"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
&mdash;literally, created "for or in reference to making,"
the word for making being one of those already referred to.
<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The force of this expression consists in its intimating that God
had not only finished the work of <i>creation</i>, properly so called,
but also the elaboration of the various details of the universe,
as formed or fashioned out of the original materials. Of a
similar character is the expression in Isaiah xlii., 5, "Jehovah,
he that <i>created</i> the heavens and spread them out;" and that in
Psalm cxlviii., 5, "He commanded and they were <i>created</i>, he hath
also established them for ever and ever."</p>

<p>In as far as I am aware, the word <i>bara</i> in all the remaining
instances of its occurrence in the Pentateuch refers to the
creation of man, with the following exceptions: Exodus xxxiv.,
10, "I will do (create) marvels, such as have not been seen in
all the earth;" Numbers xvi., 30, "If the Lord make a new thing
(create a creation), and the earth open her mouth and swallow
them up." These verses are types of a class of expressions in
which the proper term for creation is applied to the production
of something new, strange, and marvellous; for instance, "Create
in me a clean heart, O Lord;" "Behold, I create new heavens and a
new earth." It is, however, evidently an inversion of sound
exposition to say that these secondary or figurative meanings
should determine the primary and literal sense in Genesis i. On
the contrary, we should rather infer that the sacred writers in
these cases selected the proper word for creation, to express in
the most forcible manner the novel and thorough character of the
changes to which they refer, and their direct dependence on the
Divine will. By such expressions we are in effect referred back
to the original use
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of the word, as denoting the actual creation
of matter by the command of God, in contradistinction from those
arrangements which have been effected by the gradual operation of
secondary agents, or of laws attached to matter at its creation.
It has been farther observed
<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
 that in the Hebrew Scriptures
this word <i>bara</i> is applied to God only as an agent, not to any
human artificer; a fact which is very important with reference to
its true significance. Viewing creation in this light, we need
not perplex ourselves with the question whether we should
consider Genesis i., 1, to refer to the essence of matter as
distinguished from its qualities. We may content ourselves with
the explanation given by Paul in the eleventh of Hebrews: "By
faith we are certain that the worlds
<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
 were created by the
decree of God, so that that which <i>is seen</i> was made of that
which <i>appears not</i>." Or, with reference to the other uses of the
word, if the first introduction of animal life was a creation,
and if the introduction of the rational nature of man was a
creation, we may suppose that the original creation was in like
manner the introduction or first production of those entities
which we call matter and force, and which to science now are as
much ultimate facts as they were to Moses.</p>

<p>The <i>nature</i> of the act of creation being thus settled, its
<i>extent</i> may be ascertained by an examination of the terms heaven
and earth.</p>

<p>
The word "heavens" (<i>shamayim</i>) has in Hebrew as in English a
variety of significations. Of material heavens there are, in the
quaint language of Poole, "<i>tres regiones, ubi aves, ubi nubes,
ubi sidera</i>;" or (1) the atmosphere or firmament;
<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
(2) the region of clouds in the upper part of the atmosphere;
<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
(3) the depths of space comprehending the starry orbs.
<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Besides these we have the "heaven of heavens," the abode of God and spiritual
beings.
<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
The application of the term "heaven" to the
atmosphere will be considered when we reach the 6th and 7th
verses. In the mean time we may accept the word in this place as
including the material heavens in the widest sense: (1.) Because
it is not here, as in verse 8th, restricted to the atmosphere by
the terms of the narrative; this restriction in verse 8th in fact
implying the wider sense of the word in preceding verses. (2.)
Because the atmospheric firmament, elsewhere called heaven,
divides the waters above from those below, whereas it is evident
that all these waters, and of consequence the materials of the
atmosphere itself, are included in the earth of the following
verse. (3.) Because in verse 14th the sidereal heavens are spoken
of as arranged from pre-existing materials, which refers their
actual creation back to this passage.</p>

<p>
In the words now under consideration we therefore regard the
heavens as including the whole material universe beyond the
limits of our earth. That this sense of the word is not unknown
to the writers of Scripture, and that they had enlarged and
rational views of the star-spangled abysses of space, will appear
from the terms employed by Moses in his solemn warning against
the Sab&aelig;an idolatry, in Deuteronomy iv.: "And lest thou lift up
thine eyes to the heavens, and when thou seest the sun and the
moon and the stars, even all the host of the heavens, shouldest
be incited to worship them and serve them which Jehovah thy God
hath appointed to all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
nations under the whole heavens." To the
same effect is the expression of the awe and wonder of the poet
king of Israel in Psalm viii.:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em;font-size:90%;">"When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers,<br />
The moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;<br />
What is man that thou art mindful of him?"</p>

<p>I may observe, however, that throughout the Scriptures the word
in question is much more frequently applied to the atmospheric
than to the sidereal heavens. The reason of this appears in the
terms of verse 8th.</p>

<p>If we have correctly referred the term "heavens" to the whole of
extramundane space, then the word "earth" must denote our globe
as a distinct world, with all the liquid and aeriform substances
on its surface. The arrangement of the whole universe under the
heads "heaven" and "earth" has been derided as a division into
"infinity and an atom;" but when we consider the relative
importance of the earth to us, and that it constitutes the
principal object of the whole revelation to which this is
introductory, the absurdity disappears, and we recognize the
classification as in the circumstances natural and rational. The
word "earth" (<i>aretz</i>) is, however, generally used to denote the
dry land, or even a region or district of country. It is indeed
expressly restricted to the dry land in verse 10th; but as in the
case of the parallel limitation of the word "heaven," we may
consider this as a hint that its previous meaning is more
extended. That it is really so, appears from the following
considerations: (1.) It includes the deep, or the material from
which the sea and atmosphere were afterwards formed. (2.) The
subsequent verses show that at the period in question no dry land
existed. If instances of a similar meaning from other parts of
Scripture are required, I give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the following: Genesis ii., 1 to
4, "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the
host of them;" "these are the generations of the heavens and the
earth.' In this general summary of the creative work, the earth
evidently includes the seas and all that is in them, as well as
the dry land; and the whole expression denotes the universe. The
well-known and striking remark of Job, "Who hangeth the earth
upon nothing," is also a case in point, and must refer to the
whole world, since in other parts of the same book the dry land
or continental masses of the earth are said, and with great truth
and propriety, to be supported above the waters on pillars or
foundations. The following passages may also be cited as
instances of the occurrence of the idea of the whole world
expressed by the word "earth:" Exodus x., 29, "And Moses said
unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread
abroad my hands unto the Lord, and the thunder shall cease,
neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know the
earth is the Lord's;" Deuteronomy x., 14, "Behold, the heaven and
the heaven of heavens is the Lord's, the earth also, and all that
therein is."</p>

<p>The material universe was brought into existence in the
"beginning"&mdash;a term evidently indefinite as far as regards any
known epoch, and implying merely priority to all other recorded
events. It can not be the first day, for there is no expressed
connection, and the work of the first day is distinct from that
of the beginning. It can not be a general term for the whole six
days, since these are separated from it by that chaotic or
formless state to which we are next introduced. The beginning,
therefore, is the threshold of creation&mdash;the line that separates
the old tenantless condition of space from the world-crowded
galaxies of the existing universe. The only other information
respecting it that we have in Scripture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
is in that fine
descriptive poem in Proverbs viii., in which the Wisdom of God
personified&mdash;who may be held to represent the Almighty Word, or
Logos, introduced in the formula "God said," and afterward
referred to in Scripture as the manifested or conditioned Deity,
the Mediator between man and the otherwise inaccessible Divinity,
the agent in the work of creation as well as in that of
redemption&mdash;narrates the origin of all created things:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"Jehovah possessed
<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
 me, the beginning of his way,<br />
Before his work of old.<br />
I was set up from everlasting,<br />
From the beginning, before the earth was;<br />
When there were no deeps I was brought forth,<br />
When there were no fountains abounding in water."</p>

<p>The beginning here precedes the creation of the earth, as well as
of the deep which encompassed its surface in its earliest
condition. The beginning, in this point of view, stretches back
from the origin of the world into the depths of eternity. It is
to us emphatically <i>the</i> beginning, because it witnessed the
birth of our material system; but to the eternal Jehovah it was
but the beginning of a great series of his operations, and we
have no information of its absolute duration. From the time when
God began to create the celestial orbs, until that time when it
could be said that he had created the heavens and the earth,
countless ages may have rolled along, and myriads of worlds may
have passed through various stages of existence, and the creation
of our planetary system may have been one of the last acts of
that long beginning.</p>

<p>The author of creation is Elohim, or God in his general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
aspect to nature and man, and not in that special aspect in reference to
the Hebrew commonwealth and to the work of redemption indicated
by the name Jehovah (<i>Iaveh</i>). We need not enter into the
doubtful etymology of the word; but may content ourselves with
that supported by many, perhaps the majority of authorities,
which gives it the meaning of "Object of dread or adoration," or
with that preferred by Gesenius, which makes it mean the "Strong
or mighty one." Its plural form has also greatly tried the
ingenuity of the commentators. After carefully considering the
various hypotheses, such as that of the plural of majesty of the
Rabbins, and the primitive polytheism supposed by certain
Rationalists, I can see no better reason than an attempt to give
a grammatical expression to that plurality in unity indicated by
the appearance of the Spirit or breath of God and his Word, or
manifested will and power, as distinct agents in the succeeding
verses. This was probably always held by the Hebrews in a general
form; and was by our Saviour and his apostles specialized in that
trinitarian doctrine which enables both John and Paul explicitly
to assert the agency of the second person of the Trinity in the
creative work.</p>

<p>This elementary trinitarian idea of the first chapter of Genesis
may be further stated thus: The name Elohim expresses the
absolute unconditioned will and reason&mdash;the Godhead. The
manifestation of God in creative power, and in the framing and
ordering of the cosmos, is represented by the formula "God
said"&mdash;the equivalent of the Divine Word. The further
manifestation of God in love of and sympathy with his work is
represented by the Breath of God, and by the expression, "God saw
that it was good"&mdash;operations these of the Divine Spirit.</p>

<p>The aboriginal root of the word Elohim probably lies far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
back of the Semitic literature, and comes from the natural exclamations
"al," "lo," "la," which arise from the spontaneous action of the
human vocal organs in the presence of any object of awe or
wonder. The plural form may in like manner be simply equivalent
to our terms Godhead or Divinity, implying all that is
essentially God without specification or distinction of
personalities. As Dr. Tayler Lewis well remarks in his
"Introduction to Genesis," we should not dismiss such plurals as
mere <i>usus loquendi</i>. The plural form of the name of God, of the
heavens (literally, the "heights"), of the <i>olamim</i>, or
time-worlds, of the word for life in Genesis (lives), indicates
an idea of vastness and diversity not measurable by speech, which
must have been impressed on the minds of early men, otherwise
these forms would not have arisen. God, heaven, time, life, were
to them existences stretching outward to infinity, and not to be
denoted by the bare singular form suitable to ordinary objects.</p>

<p>Fairly regarding, then, this ancient form of words, we may hold
it as a clear, concise, and accurate enunciation of an ultimate
doctrine of the origin of things, which with all our increased
knowledge of the history of the earth we are not in a position to
replace with any thing better or more probable. On the other
hand, this sublime dogma of creation leaves us perfectly free to
interrogate nature for ourselves, as to all that it can reveal of
the duration and progress of the creative work. But the positive
gain which comes from this ancient formula goes far beyond these
negative qualities. If received, this one word of the Old
Testament is sufficient to deliver us forever from the
superstitious dread of nature, and to present it to us as neither
self-existent nor omnipotent, but as the mere handiwork of a
spiritual Creator to whom we are kin; as not a product of chance
or caprice, but as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
result of a definite plan of the
All-wise; as not a congeries of unconnected facts and processes,
but as a cosmos, a well-ordered though complex machine, designed
by Him who is the Almighty and the supreme object of reverence.
Had this verse alone constituted the whole Bible, this one
utterance would, wherever known and received, have been an
inestimable boon to mankind; proclaiming deliverance to the
captives of every form of nature-worship and idolatry, and fixing
that idea of unity of plan in the universe which is the fruitful
and stable root of all true progress in science. We owe profound
thanks to the old Hebrew prophet for these words&mdash;words which
have broken from the necks of once superstitious Aryan races
chains more galling than those of Egyptian bondage.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">THE DESOLATE VOID.</span><br /><br />

<span style="font-size:50%;">"And the earth was desolate and empty,
and darkness was upon the surface of the deep; and the Spirit of God
moved on the surface of the waters."&mdash;Genesis i., 2.</span></h2>


<p>We have here a few bold outlines of a dark and mysterious
scene&mdash;a condition of the earth of which we have no certain
intimation from any other source, except the speculations based
on modern discoveries in physical science. It was "unshaped and
empty," formless and uninhabited. The words thus translated are
sufficiently plain in their meaning. The first is used by Isaiah
to denote the desolation of a ruined city, and in Job and the
Psalms as characteristic of the wilderness or desert. Both in
connection are employed by Isaiah to express the destruction of
Idumea, and by Jeremiah in a powerful description of the ruin of
nations by God's judgments. When thus united, they form the
strongest expression which the Hebrew could supply for solitary,
uninhabited desolation, like that of a city reduced to heaps of
rubbish, and to the silence and loneliness of utter decay.</p>

<p>In the present connection these words inform us that the earth
was in a chaotic state, and unfit for the residence of organized
beings. The words themselves suggest the important question: Are
they intended to represent this as the original condition of the
earth? Was it a scene of desolation and confusion when it sprang
from the hand of its Creator?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
or was this state of ruin consequent on convulsions which may have been preceded by a very
different condition, not mentioned by the inspired historian?
That it may have been so is rendered possible by the circumstance
that the words employed are generally used to denote the ruin of
places formerly inhabited, and by the want of any necessary
connection in time between the first and second verses. It has
even been proposed, though this does violence to the
construction, to read "and the earth became" desolate and empty.
Farther, it seems, <i>&agrave; priori</i>, improbable that the first act of
creative power should have resulted in the production of a mere
chaos. The crust of the earth also shows, in its alternations of
strata and organic remains, evidence of a great series of changes
extending over vast periods, and which might, in a revelation
intended for moral purposes, with great propriety be omitted.</p>

<p>For such reasons some eminent expositors of these words are
disposed to consider the first verse as a title or introduction,
and to refer to this period the whole series of geological
changes; and this view has formed one of the most popular
solutions of the apparent discrepancies between the geological
and Scriptural histories of the world. It is evident, however,
that if we continue to view the term "earth" as including the
whole globe, this hypothesis becomes altogether untenable. The
subsequent verses inform us that at the period in question the
earth was covered by a universal ocean, possessed no atmosphere
and received no light, and had not entered into its present
relations with the other bodies of our system. No conceivable
convulsions could have effected such changes on an earth
previously possessing these arrangements; and geology assures us
that the existing laws and dispositions in these respects have
prevailed from the earliest periods to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
which it can lead us back, and that the modern state of things was not separated from
those which preceded it by any such general chaos. To avoid this
difficulty, which has been much more strongly felt as these facts
have been more and more clearly developed by modern science, it
has been held that the word earth may denote only a particular
region, temporarily obscured and reduced to ruin, and about to be
fitted up, by the operations of the six days, for the residence
of man; and that consequently the narrative of the six days
refers not to the original arrangement of the surface, relations,
and inhabitants of our planet, but to the retrieval from ruin and
repeopling of a limited territory, supposed to have been in
Central Asia, and which had been submerged and its atmosphere
obscured by aqueous or volcanic vapors. The chief support of this
view is the fact, previously noticed, that the word earth is very
frequently used in the signification of region, district,
country; to which may be added the supposed necessity for
harmonizing the Scriptures with geological discovery, and at the
same time viewing the days of creation as literal solar days.</p>

<p>Can we, however, after finding that in verse 1st the term earth
must mean the whole world, suddenly restrict it in verse 2d to a
limited region. Is it possible that the writer who in verse 10th
for the first time intimates a limitation of the meaning of this
word, by the solemn announcement, "And God called the <i>dry land</i>
earth," should in a previous place use it in a much more limited
sense without any hint of such restriction. The case stands thus:
A writer uses the word earth in the most general sense; in the
next sentence he is supposed, without any intimation of his
intention, to use the same word to denote a region or country,
and by so doing entirely to change the meaning of his whole
discourse from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
that which would otherwise have attached to it.
Yet the same writer when, a few sentences farther on, it becomes
necessary for him to use the word earth to denote the dry land as
distinguished from the seas, formally and with an assertion of
divine authority, intimates the change of meaning. Is not this
supposition contrary not only to sound principles of
interpretation, but also to common-sense; and would it not tend
to render worthless the testimony of a writer to whose diction
such inaccuracy must be ascribed. It is in truth to me surprising
beyond measure that such a view could ever have obtained
currency; and I fear it is to be attributed to a determination,
at all hazards and with any amount of violence to the written
record, to make geology and religion coincide. Must we then throw
aside this simple and convenient method of reconciliation,
sanctioned by Chalmers, Smith, Harris, King, Hitchcock, and many
other great or respectable names, and on which so many good men
complacently rest. Truth obliges us to do so, and to confess that
both geology and Scripture refuse to be reconciled on this basis.
We may still admit that the lapse of time between the beginning
and the first day may have been great; but we must emphatically
deny that this interval corresponds with the time indicated by
the series of fossiliferous rocks.</p>

<p>Before leaving this part of the subject, I may remark that the
desolate and empty condition of the earth was not necessarily a
chaotic mass of confusion&mdash;<i>rudis indigestaque moles</i>; but in
reality, when physically considered, may have been a more
symmetrical and homogeneous condition than any that it
subsequently assumed. If the earth were first a vast globe of
vapor, then a liquid spheroid, and then acquired a crust not yet
seamed by fissures or broken by corrugations, and eventually
covered with a universal ocean, then in each of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
these early conditions it would, in regard to its form, be a more perfect
globe than at any succeeding time. That something of this kind is
the intention of our historian is implied in his subsequent
statements as to the absence of land and the prevalence of a
universal ocean in the immediately succeeding period, which imply
that the crust had not yet been ruptured or disturbed, but
presented an even and uniform surface, no part of which could
project above the comparatively thin fluid envelope.</p>

<p>The second clause introduces a new object&mdash;"<i>the deep</i>." Whatever
its precise nature, this is evidently something included in the
earth of verse 1st, and created with it. The word occurs in other
parts of the Hebrew Scriptures in various senses. It often
denotes the sea, especially when in an agitated state (Psa.
xlii., 8; Job xxxviii., 10). In Psalm cxxxv., however, it is
distinguished from the sea: "Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that
did he in heaven, in the earth, in the seas, and <i>in all deeps</i>."
In other cases it has been supposed to refer to interior recesses
of the earth, as when at the deluge "the fountains of the great
deep" are said to have been broken up. It is probable, however,
that this refers to the ocean. In some places it would appear to
mean the atmosphere or its waters; as Prov. viii., 27-29, "When
he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he described a circle
on the face of the deep, when he established the clouds above,
when he strengthened the fountains of the deep." The Septuagint
in this passage reads "throne on the winds" and "fountains under
the heaven."
<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
 Though we can not attach much value to these
readings, there seems little reason to doubt that the author of
this passage understands by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
deep the atmospheric waters, and not the sea, which he mentions separately. The same meaning must
be attached to the word in another passage of the Book of
Proverbs: "The Lord in wisdom hath founded the earth, by
understanding hath he established the heavens; by his knowledge
the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the small
rain."</p>

<p>In the passage now under consideration, it would seem that we
have both the deep and the waters mentioned, and this not in a
way which would lead us to infer their identity. The darkness on
the surface of the deep and the Spirit of God on the face of the
waters seem to refer to the condition of two distinct objects at
the same time. Neither can the word here refer to subterranean
cavities, for the ascription of a surface to these, and the
statement that they were enveloped in darkness, would in this
case have neither meaning nor use. For these reasons I am induced
to believe that the locality of the deep or abyss is to be
sought, not in the universal ocean or the interior of the earth,
but in the vaporous or aeriform mass mantling the surface of our
nascent planet, and containing the materials out of which the
atmosphere was afterward elaborated. This is a view leading to
important consequences: one of which is that the darkness on the
surface of the deep can not have been, as believed by the
advocates of a local chaos, a mere atmospheric obscuration; since
even at the <i>surface</i> of what then represented the atmosphere
darkness prevailed. "God covered the earth with the deep as with
a garment, and the waters stood above the hills," and without
this outer garment was the darkness of space destitute of
luminaries, at least of those greater ones which are of primary
importance to us. We learn from the following verses that there
was no layer of clear atmosphere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
in this misty deep, separating the clouds from the ocean waters.</p>

<p>The last clause of the verse has always been obscure, and perhaps
it is still impossible to form a clear idea of the operation
intended to be described. We are not even certain whether it is
intended to represent any thing within the compass of ordinary
natural laws, or to denote a direct intervention of the Creator,
miraculous in its nature and confined to one period. It is
possible that the general intention of the statement may be to
the effect that the agency of the divine power in separating the
waters from the incumbent vapors had already commenced&mdash;that the
Spirit which would afterward evoke so many wonders out of the
chaotic mass was already acting upon it in an unseen and
mysterious way, preparing it for its future destiny.</p>

<p>Some commentators, both Jewish and Christian, are, however,
disposed to view the <i>Ruach Elohim</i>, Spirit, or breath of God, as
meaning a wind of God, or mighty wind, according to a well-known
Hebrew idiom. The word in its primary sense means wind or breath,
and there are undoubted instances of the expression "wind of God"
for a great or strong wind. For example, Isaiah xl., 7: "The
grass withereth because the wind of the Lord bloweth upon it;"
see also 2 Kings ii., 16. Such examples, however, are very rare,
and by no means sufficient of themselves to establish this
interpretation. Those who hold this view do so mainly in
consideration of the advantage which it affords in attaching a
definite meaning to the expression. Many of them are not,
however, aware of its precise import in a cosmical point of view.
A violent wind, before the formation of the atmosphere, and the
establishment of the laws which regulate the suspension and
motions of aqueous vapors and clouds, must have been merely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
an agitation of the confused misty and vaporous mass of the deep;
since, as Ainsworth&mdash;more careful than modern interpreters&mdash;long
ago observed, "winde (which is the moving of the aier) was not
created till the second day, that the firmament was spred, and
the aier made." Such an agitation is by no means improbable. It
would be a very likely accompaniment of a boiling ocean, resting
on a heated surface, and of excessive condensation of moisture in
the upper regions of the atmosphere; and might act as an
influential means of preparing the earth for the operations of
the second day. It is curious also that the Phoenician
cosmogony is said to have contained the idea of a mighty wind in
connection with this part of creation, and the idea of seething
or commotion in the primitive chaos also occurs in the Assyrian
tablets of creation, while the Quich&eacute; legend represents Hurakon,
the storm-god, as specially concerned in the creative work.
<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
On the other hand, the verb used in the text rather expresses
hovering or brooding than violent motion, and this better
corresponds with the old fable of the mundane egg, which seems to
have been derived from the event recorded in this verse. The more
evangelical view, which supposes the Holy Spirit to be intended,
is also more in accordance with the general scope of the
Scripture teachings on this subject; and the opposite idea is, as
Calvin well says, "too frigid" to meet with much favor from
evangelical theologians.</p>

<p>Chaos, the equivalent of the Hebrew "desolation and emptiness,"
figures largely in all ancient cosmogonies. That of the Egyptians
is interesting, not only from its resemblance to the Hebrew
doctrine, but also from its probable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
connection with the cosmogony of the Greeks. Taking the version of Diodorus Siculus,
which though comparatively modern, yet corresponds with the hints
derived from older sources, we find the original chaos to have
been an intermingled condition of elements constituting heaven
and earth. This is the Hebrew "deep." The first step of progress
is the separation of these; the fiery particles ascending above,
and not only producing light, but the revolution of the heavenly
bodies&mdash;a curious foreshadowing of the nebular hypothesis of
modern astronomy. After these, in the terms of the lines quoted
by Diodorus from Euripides, plants, birds, mammals, and finally
man are produced, not however by a direct creative fiat, but by
the spontaneous fecundity of the teeming earth. The Phoenician
cosmogony attributed to Sancuniathon has the void, the deep, and
the brooding Spirit; and one of the terms employed, "baau," is
the same with the Hebrew "bohu," void, if read without the
points. The Babylonians, according to Berosus, believed in a
chaos&mdash;which, however, like the literal-day theory of some
moderns, produced many monsters before Belus intervened to
separate heaven and earth. But the Assyrian legend found in the
Nineveh tablets is very precise in its intimation of the Chaos or
<i>Tiamat</i>, the mother of all things; and, farther, it recognizes
this personified chaos as the principle of evil, whose "dragon"
becomes the tempter of the progenitors of mankind, exactly like
the Biblical serpent. This "dragon of the abyss" is thus
identical in name and function with the evil principle even of
the last book of the New Testament, and we have in this also
probably the origin of the Ahriman of the Avesta. Thus in these
Eastern theologies the primeval chaos becomes the type of evil as
opposed to the order, beauty, and goodness of the creation of
God&mdash;a very natural association; but one kept in the background
by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the Hebrew Scriptures, as tending to a dualistic belief
subversive of monotheism. The Greek myth of Chaos, and its
children Erebus and Night, who give birth to Aether and Day, is
the same tradition, personified after the fanciful manner of a
people who, in the primitive period of their civilization, had no
profound appreciation of nature, but were full of human
sympathies.
<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
 Lastly, in a hymn translated by Dr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
 Max M&uuml;ller from the Rig-Veda, a work probably far older than the Institutes
of Menu, we have such utterances as the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"Nor aught nor nought existed: yon bright sky<br />
Was not, nor heaven's broad woof outstretched above.<br />
What covered all? what sheltered? what concealed?<br />
Was it the water's fathomless abyss? * * *<br />
Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled<br />
In gloom profound&mdash;an ocean without light;<br />
The germ that still lay covered in the husk<br />
Burst forth, one nature, from the fervent heat."</p>

<p>It is evident that the state of our planet which we have just
been considering is one of which we can scarcely form any
adequate conception, and science can in no way aid us, except by
suggesting hypotheses or conjectures. It is remarkable, however,
that nearly all the cosmological theories which have been devised
contain some of the elements of the inspired narrative. The words
of Moses appear to suggest a heated and cooling globe, its crust
as yet unbroken by internal forces, covered by a universal ocean,
on which rested a mass of confused vaporous substances; and it is
of such materials, thus combined by the sacred historian, that
cosmologists have built up their several theories, aqueous or
igneous, of the early state of the earth. Geology, as a science
of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
observation and induction, does not carry us back to this
period. It must still and always say, with Hutton, that it can
find "no trace of a beginning, no prospect of an end"&mdash;not
because there has been no beginning or will be no end, but
because the facts which it collects extend neither to the one nor
the other. Geology, like every other department of natural
history, can but investigate the facts which are open to
observation, and reason on these in accordance with the known
laws and arrangements of existing nature. It finds these laws to
hold for the oldest period to which the rocky archives of the
earth extend. Respecting the origin of these general laws and
arrangements, or the condition of the earth before they
originated, it knows nothing. In like manner a botanist may
determine the age of a forest by counting the growth rings of the
oldest trees, but he can tell nothing of the forests that may
have preceded it, or of the condition of the surface before it
supported a forest. So the arch&aelig;ologist may on Egyptian monuments
read the names and history of successive dynasties of kings, but
he can tell nothing of the state of the country and its native
tribes before those dynasties began or their monuments were
built. Yet geology at least establishes a probability that a time
was when organized beings did not exist, and when many of the
arrangements of the surface of our earth had not been perfected;
and the few facts which have given birth to the theories
promulgated on this subject tend to show that this pre-geological
condition of the earth may have been such as that described in
the words now under consideration. I may remark, in addition,
that if the words of Moses imply the cooling of the globe from a
molten or intensely heated state down to a temperature at which
water could exist on its surface, the known rate of cooling of
bodies of the dimensions and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
materials of the earth shows that
the time included in these two verses of Genesis must have been
enormous, amounting it may be to many millions of years.</p>

<p>There are two other sciences besides geology which have in modern
times attempted to penetrate into the mysteries of the primitive
abyss, at least by hypothetical explanations&mdash;astronomy and
chemistry. The magnificent nebular hypothesis of La Place, which
explains the formation of the whole solar system by the
condensation of a revolving mass of gaseous matter, would
manifestly bring our earth to the condition of a fluid body, with
or without a solid crust, and surrounded by a huge atmosphere of
its more volatile materials, gradually condensing itself around
the central nucleus. Chemistry informs us that this vaporous mass
would contain not only the atmospheric air and water, but all the
carbon, sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, and other elements,
volatile in themselves, or forming volatile compounds with oxygen
or hydrogen, that are now imprisoned in various states of
combination in the solid crust of the earth. Such an
atmosphere&mdash;vast, dark, pestilential, and capable in its
condensation of producing the most intense chemical action&mdash;is a
necessity of an earth condensing from a vaporous and incandescent
state. Thus, in so far as scientific speculation ventures to
penetrate into the genesis of the earth, its conclusions are at
one with the Mosaic cosmogony and with the traditions of most
ancient nations as to the primitive existence of a
chaos&mdash;formless and void, in which "nor aught nor nought
existed."</p>

<p>Some of the details of the Mosaic vision of the primeval chaos
may be supplied by the probabilities established by physics and
chemistry. Our first idea of the earth would be a vast vaporous
ball, recently spun out from the general mass of vapors forming
the nebula which once represented the solar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
system. This huge cloud, whirling its annual round about the still vaporous centre
of the system, would consist of all the materials now
constituting the solid rocks as well as those of the seas and
atmosphere, their atoms kept asunder by the force of heat,
preventing not only their mechanical union, but even their
chemical combination. But heat is being radiated on all sides
into space, and the opposing force of gravitation is little by
little gathering the particles toward the centre. At length a
liquid nucleus is formed, while upon this are being precipitated
showers of condensing matter from the still vast atmosphere to
add to its volume. As this process advances, a new brilliancy is
given to the feebly shining vapors by the incandescence of solid
particles in the upper layers of the atmosphere, and in this
stage our earth would be a little sun, a miniature of that which
now forms the centre of our system, and which still, by virtue of
its greater mass, continues in this state. But at length, by
further cooling, this brilliancy is lost, and the still fluid
globe is surrounded by a vast cloudy pall, in which condensing
vapors gather in huge dark masses, and amid terrible electrical
explosions, pour, in constantly increasing, acid, corrosive
rains, upon the heated nucleus, combining with its materials, or
again flashing into vapors. Thus darkness dense and gross would
settle upon the vaporous deep, and would continue for long ages,
until the atmosphere could be finally cleared of its superfluous
vapors. In the mean time a crust of slag or cinder has been
forming upon the molten nucleus. Broken again and again by the
heaving of the seething mass, it at length sets permanently, and
finally allows some portion of the liquid rain condensed upon it
to remain as a boiling ocean. Then began the reign of the waters,
under which the first stratified rocks were laid down by the
deposit of earthy and saline matter suspended or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
dissolved in the heated sea. Such is the picture which science presents to us
of the genesis of the earth, and so far as we can judge from his
words, such must have been the picture presented to the mental
vision of the ancient seer of creation; but he could discern also
that mysterious influence, the "breath of Elohim," which moved on
the face of the waters, and prepared for the evolution of land
and of life from their bosom. He saw&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"An earth&mdash;formless and void;<br />
A vaporous abyss&mdash;dark at its very surface;<br />
A universal ocean&mdash;the breath of God hovering over it."</p>

<p>How could such a scene be represented in words? since it
presented none of the familiar features of the actual world. Had
he attempted to dilate upon it, he would, in the absence of the
facts furnished by modern science, have been obliged, like the
writers of some of the less simple and primitive cosmogonies
already quoted,
<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
 to adopt the feeble expedient of enumerating
the things not present. He wisely contents himself with a few
well-chosen words, which boldly sketch the crude materials of a
world hopeless and chaotic but for the animating breath of the
Almighty, who has created even that old chaos out of which is to
be worked in the course of the six creative days all the variety
and beauty of a finished world.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the reader will perceive how this reticence of the
author of Genesis strengthens the argument for the primitive age
of the document, and for the vision-theory as to its origin; and
will also observe that, in the conception of this ancient writer,
the "promise and potency" of order and life reside not alone in
the atoms of a vaporous world, but also in the will of its
Creator.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br/><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">LIGHT AND CREATIVE DAYS.</span><br/><br />

<span style="font-size:50%;">"And God said, Let light be,
and light was; and God saw the light that it was good, and separated the
light from the darkness; and God called the light Day; and the darkness
he called Night. And Evening was and Morning was&mdash;Day one."&mdash;
Genesis i., 3-5.</span></h2>


<p>Light is the first element of order and perfection introduced
upon our planet&mdash;the first innovation on the old r&eacute;gime of
darkness and desolation. There is a beautiful propriety in this,
for the Hebrew <i>Aur</i> (light) should be viewed as including heat
and electricity as well as light; and these three forces&mdash;if they
are really distinct, and not merely various movements of one and
the same ether&mdash;are in themselves, or the proximate causes of
their manifestation, the prime movers of the machinery of nature,
the vivifying forces without which the primeval desolation would
have been eternal. The statement presented here is, however, a
bold one. Light without luminaries, which were afterward
formed&mdash;independent light, so to speak, shining all around the
earth&mdash;is an idea not likely to have occurred in the days of
Moses to the framer of a fictitious cosmogony, and yet it
corresponds in a remarkable manner with some of the theories
which have grown out of modern induction.</p>

<p>I have said that the Hebrew word translated "light" includes the
vibratory movements which we call heat and electricity as well. I
make this statement, not intending to assert that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the Hebrews experimented on these forces in the manner of modern science, and
would therefore be prepared to understand their laws or
correlations as fully as we can. I give the word this general
sense simply because throughout the Bible it is used to denote
the solar light and heat, and also the electric light of the
thunder-cloud: "the light of His cloud," "the bright light which
is in the clouds." The absence of "<i>aur</i>," therefore, in the
primeval earth, is the absence of solar radiation, of the
lightning's flash, and of volcanic fires. We shall in the
succeeding verses find additional reasons for excluding all these
phenomena from the darkness of the primeval night.</p>

<p>The light of the first day can not reasonably be supposed to have
been in any other than a visible and active state. Whether light
be, as supposed by the older physicists, luminous matter radiated
with immense velocity, or, as now appears more probable, merely
the undulations of a universally diffused ether, its motion had
already commenced. The idea of the matter of light as distinct
from its power of affecting the senses does not appear in the
Scriptures any farther than that the Hebrew name is probably
radically identical with the word ether now used to express the
undulating medium by which light is propagated; and if it did,
the general creation of matter being stated in verse 1, and the
notice of the separation of light and darkness being distinctly
given in the present verse, there is no place left for such a
view here. For this reason, that explanation of these words which
supposes that on the first day the <i>matter</i> of light, or the
ether whose motions produce light, was created, and that on the
fourth day, when luminaries were appointed, it became visible by
beginning to undulate, must be abandoned; and the connection
between these two statements must be sought in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
some other group of facts than that connected with the existence of the matter of
light as distinct from its undulations.</p>

<p>What, then, was the nature of the light which on the first day
shone without the presence of any local luminary? It must have
proceeded from luminous matter diffused through the whole space
of the solar system, or surrounding our globe as with a mantle.
It was "clothed with light as with a garment,"<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:90%;margin-left: 2em;">"Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun was not."</span><br /><br />

We have already rejected the hypothesis that the primeval night
proceeded from a temporary obscuration of the atmosphere; and the
expression, "God said, Let light be," affords an additional
reason, since, in accordance with the strict precision of
language which everywhere prevails in this ancient document, a
mere restoration of light would not be stated in such terms. If
we wish to find a natural explanation of the mode of illumination
referred to, we must recur to one or other of the suppositions
mentioned above, that the luminous matter formed a nebulous
atmosphere, slowly concentrating itself toward the centre of the
solar system, or that it formed a special envelope of our earth,
which subsequently disappeared.</p>

<p>We may suppose this light-giving matter to be the same with that
which now surrounds the sun, and constitutes the stratum of
luminous substance which, by its wondrous and unceasing power of
emitting light, gives him all his glory. To explain the division
of the light from the darkness, we need only suppose that the
luminous matter, in the progress of its concentration, was at
length all gathered within the earth's orbit, and then, as one
hemisphere only would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
illuminated at a time, the separation of light from darkness, or of day from night, would be
established. This hypothesis, suggested by the words themselves,
affords a simple and natural explanation of a statement otherwise
obscure.</p>

<p>It is an instructive circumstance that the probabilities
respecting the early state of our planet, thus deduced from the
Scriptural narrative, correspond very closely with the most
ingenious and truly philosophical speculation ever hazarded
respecting the origin of our solar system. I refer to the
cosmical hypothesis of La Place, which was certainly formed
without any reference to the Bible; and by persons whose views of
the Mosaic narrative are of that shallow character which is too
prevalent, has been suspected as of infidel tendency. La Place's
theory is based on the following properties of the solar system,
which will be found referred to in this connection in many
popular works on astronomy: 1. The orbits of the planets are
nearly circular. 2. They revolve nearly in the plane of the sun's
equator.
<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
 3. They all revolve round the sun in one direction,
which is also the direction of the sun's rotation. 4. They rotate
on their axes also, as far as is known, in the same direction. 5.
Their satellites, with the exception of those of Uranus and
Neptune, revolve in the same direction. Now all these
coincidences can scarcely have been fortuitous, and yet they
might have been otherwise without affecting the working of the
system; and, farther, if not fortuitous, they correspond
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
precisely with the results which would flow from the condensation
of a revolving mass of nebulous matter. La Place, therefore,
conceived that in the beginning the matter of our system existed
in the condition of a mass of vaporous material, having a central
nucleus more or less dense, and the whole rotating in a uniform
direction. Such a mass must, "in condensing by cold, leave in the
plane of its equator zones of vapor composed of substances which
required an intense degree of cold to return to a liquid or solid
state. These zones must have begun by circulating round the sun
in the form of concentric rings, the most volatile molecules of
which must have formed the superior part, and the most condensed
the inferior part. If all the nebulous molecules of which these
rings are composed had continued to cool without disuniting, they
would have ended by forming a liquid or solid ring. But the
regular constitution which all parts of the ring would require
for this, and which they would have needed to preserve when
cooling, would make this phenomenon extremely rare. Accordingly
the solar system presents only one instance of it&mdash;that of the
rings of Saturn. Generally the ring must have broken into several
parts which have continued to circulate round the sun, and with
almost equal velocity, while at the same time, in consequence of
their separation, they would acquire a rotatory motion round
their respective centres of gravity; and as the molecules of the
superior part of the ring&mdash;that is to say, those farthest from
the centre of the sun&mdash;had necessarily an absolute velocity
greater than the molecules of the inferior part which is nearest
it, the rotatory motion common to all the fragments must always
have been in the same direction with the orbitual motion.
However, if after their division one of these fragments has been
sufficiently superior to the others to unite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
them to it by its attraction, they will have formed only a mass of vapor, which, by
the continual friction of all its parts, must have assumed the
form of a spheroid, flattened at the poles and expanded in the
direction of its equator."
<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
 Here, then, are rings of vapor
left by the successive retreats of the atmosphere of the sun,
changed into so many planets in the condition of vapor,
circulating round the central orb, and possessing a rotatory
motion in the direction of their revolution, while the solar mass
was gradually contracting itself round its centre and assuming
its present organized form. Such is a general view of the
hypothesis of La Place, which may also be followed out into all
the known details of the solar system, and will be found to
account for them all. Into these details, however, we can not now
enter. Let us now compare this ingenious speculation with the
Scripture narrative. In both we have the raw material of the
heavens and the earth created before it assumed its distinct
forms. In both we have that state of the planets characterized as
without form and void, the condensing nebulous mass of La Place's
theory being in perfect correspondence with the Scriptural
"deep." In both it is implied that the permanent mutual relations
of the several bodies of the system must have been perfected long
after their origin. Lastly, supposing the luminous atmosphere of
our sun to have been of such a character as to concentrate itself
wholly around the centre of the system, and that as it became
concentrated it acquired its intense luminosity, we have in both
the production of light from the same cause; and in both it would
follow that the concentration of this matter within the orbit of
the earth would effect the separation of day from night, by
illuminating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
alternately the opposite sides of the earth. It is
true that the theory of La Place does not provide for any such
special condensation of luminous matter, nor for any precise
stage of the process as that in which the arrangements of light
and darkness should be completed; but under his hypothesis it
seems necessary to account in some such way for the sole
luminosity of the sun; and the point of separation of day and
night must have been a marked epoch in the history of the process
for each planet. The theory of accretion of matter which has in
modern times been associated with that of La Place would equally
well accord with the indications in our Mosaic record.
<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>It is further to be observed that so long as the material of the
earth constituted a part of the great vaporous mass, it would be
encompassed with its diffused light, and that after it had been
left outside the contracting solar envelope, it might still
retain some independent luminosity in its atmosphere, a trace of
which may still exist in the auroral displays of the upper strata
of the air. The earth might thus at first be in total darkness.
It might then be dimly lighted by the surrounding nebulosity, or
by a luminous envelope in its own atmosphere. Then it might, as
before explained, relapse into the darkness of its misty mantle,
and as this cleared away and the light of the sun increased and
became condensed, the latter would gradually be installed into
his office as the sole orb of day. It is quite evident that we
thus have a sufficient hypothetical explanation of the light of
the first of the creative &aelig;ons; and this is all that in the
present state of science we can expect. "Where is the way where
light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
that thou shouldest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
take it to the bound thereof, and know the
way to the house thereof?"</p>

<p>For the reasons above given, we must regard the hypothesis of the
great French astronomer as a wonderful approximation to the grand
and simple plan of the construction of our system as revealed in
Scripture. Nor must we omit to notice that the telescope and the
spectroscope reveal to us in the heavens gaseous nebular bodies
which may well be new systems in progress of formation, and in
which the Creator is even now dividing the light from the
darkness. Still another thought in connection with this subject
is that the theory of a condensing system affords a measure of
the aggregate time occupied in the work of creation. Sir William
Thomson's well-known calculations give us one hundred millions of
years as the possible age of the earth as a planetary globe; but
calculations of the sun's heat as produced by gravitation alone
would give a much less time. We have, however, a right to assume
an original heated condition of the vaporous mass from which the
sun was formed. Still the date above given would seem to be a
maximum rather than a minimum age for the solar system.</p>

<p>"God saw the light that it was good," though it illuminated but a
waste of lifeless waters. It was good because beautiful in
itself, and because God saw it in its relations to long trains of
processes and wonderful organic structures on which it was to act
as a vivifying agency. Throughout the Scriptures light is not
only good, but an emblem of higher good. In Psalm civ. God is
represented as "clothing himself with light as with a garment;"
and in many other parts of these exquisite lyrics we have similar
figures. "The Lord is my light and salvation;" "Lift up the light
of thy countenance upon me;" "The entrance of thy law giveth
light;" "The path of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
just is as a shining light." And the
great spiritual Light of the world, the "only begotten of the
Father," the mediator alike in creation and redemption, is
himself the "Sun of Righteousness." Perhaps the noblest Scripture
passage relating to the blessing of light is one in the address
of Jehovah to Job, which is unfortunately so imperfectly
translated in the English version as to be almost unintelligible:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1em;font-size:90%;">"Hast thou in thy lifetime given law to the morning,<br />
Or caused the dawn to know its place,<br />
That it may enclose the horizon in its grasp,<br />
And chase the robbers before it:<br />
It rolls along as the seal over the clay,<br />
Causing all things to stand forth in gorgeous apparel."
<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br />

<span style="margin-left: 19.5em;">Job xxxviii., 12.</span></p>


<p>The concluding words, "Day one," bring us to the consideration of
one of the most difficult problems in this history, and one on
which its significance in a great measure depends&mdash;the meaning of
the word <i>day</i>, and the length of the days of creation.</p>

<p>In pursuing this investigation, I shall refrain from noticing in
detail the views of the many able modern writers who, from
Cuvier, De Luc, and Jameson, down to Hugh Miller, Donald
McDonald, and Tayler Lewis, have maintained the period theory, or
those equally numerous and able writers who have supported the
opposite view. I acknowledge obligations to them all, but prefer
to direct my attention immediately to the record itself.</p>

<p>The first important fact that strikes us is one which has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
not received the attention it deserves, viz., that the word <i>day</i> is
evidently used in three senses in the record itself. We are told
(verse 5th) that God called the <i>light</i>, that is, the diurnal
continuance of light, day. We are also informed that the
<i>evening</i> and the <i>morning</i> were the first day. Day, therefore,
in one of these clauses is the light as separated from the
darkness, which we may call the <i>natural day</i>; in the other it is
the whole time occupied in the creation of light and its
separation from the darkness, whether that was a <i>civil or
astronomical day</i> of twenty-four hours or some longer period. In
other words, the daylight, to which God is represented as
restricting the use of the term day, is only a part of a day of
creation, which included both light and darkness, and which might
be either a civil day or a longer period, but could not be the
natural day intervening between sunrise and sunset, which is the
<i>ordinary</i> day of Scripture phraseology. Again, in the 4th verse
of chapter ii., which begins the second part of the history, the
whole creative week is called one day&mdash;"In the day that Jehovah
Elohim made the earth and the heavens." Such an expression must
surely in such a place imply more than a mere inadvertence on the
part of the writer or writers.</p>

<p>To pave the way for a right understanding of the day of creation,
it may be well to consider, in the first place, the manner in
which the <i>shorter day</i> is introduced. In the expression, "God
<i>called</i> the light day," we find for the first time the Creator
naming his works, and we may infer that some important purpose
was to be served by this. The nature of this purpose we ascertain
by comparison with other instances of the same kind occurring in
the chapter. God called the darkness night, the firmament heaven,
the dry land earth, the gathered waters seas. In all these cases
the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
purpose seems to have been one of verbal definition, perhaps
along with an assertion of sovereignty. It was necessary to
distinguish the diurnal darkness from that unvaried darkness
which had been of old, and to discriminate between the limited
waters of an earth having dry land on its surface and those of
the ancient universal ocean. This is effected by introducing two
new terms, night and seas. In like manner it was necessary to
mark the new application of the term earth to the dry land, and
that of heaven to the atmosphere, more especially as these were
the senses in which the words were to be popularly used. The
intention, therefore, in all these cases was to affix to certain
things names different from those which they had previously borne
in the narrative, and to certain terms new senses differing from
those in which they had been previously used. Applying this
explanation here, it results that the probable reason for calling
the light day is to point out that the word occurs in two senses,
and that while it was to be the popular and proper term for the
natural day, this sense must be distinguished from its other
meaning as a day of creation. In short, we may take this as a
plain and authoritative declaration <i>that the day of creation is
not the day of popular speech</i>. We see in this a striking
instance of the general truth that in the simplicity of the
structure of this record we find not carelessness, but studied
and severe precision, and are warned against the neglect of the
smallest peculiarities in its diction.</p>

<p>What, then, is the day of creation, as distinguished by Moses
himself from the natural day. The general opinion, and that which
at first sight appears most probable, is that it is merely the
ordinary civil day of twenty-four hours. Those who adopt this
view insist on the impropriety of diverting the word from its
usual sense. Unfortunately, however, for this argument,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the word is not very frequently used in the Scriptures for the whole
twenty-four hours of the earth's revolution. Its etymology gives
it the sense of the time of glowing or warmth, and in accordance
with this the divine authority here limits its meaning to the
daylight. Accordingly throughout the Hebrew Scriptures <i>yom</i> is
generally the natural and not the civil day; and where the latter
is intended, the compound terms "day and night" and "evening and
morning" are frequently used. Any one who glances over the word
"day" in a good English concordance can satisfy himself of this
fact. But the sense of natural day from sunrise to sunset is
expressly excluded here by the context, as already shown; and all
that we can say in favor of the interpretation that limits the
day of creation to twenty-four hours, is that next to the use of
the word for the natural day, which is its true popular meaning,
its use for the civil day is perhaps the most frequent. It is
therefore by no means a statement of the whole truth to affirm,
as many writers have done, that the civil day is <i>the ordinary</i>
meaning of the term. At the same time we may admit that this is
<i>one</i> of its ordinary meanings, and therefore may be its meaning
here. Another argument frequently urged is that the day of
creation is said to have had an evening and morning. We shall
consider this more fully in the sequel, and in the mean time may
observe that it appears rather hazardous to attribute an ordinary
evening and morning to a day which, on the face of the record,
preceded the formation and arrangement of the luminaries which
are "for days and for years."
<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
But it may be affirmed that in the Bible long and undefined
periods are indicated by the word "day." In many of these cases
the word is in the plural: as Genesis iv., 3, "And after days it
came to pass," rendered in our version "in process of time;"
Genesis xl., 4, "days in ward," rendered "a season." Such
instances as these are not applicable to the present question,
since the plural may have the sense of indefinite time, merely by
denoting an undetermined number of natural days. Passages in
which the singular occurs in this sense are those which strictly
apply to the case in hand, and such are by no means rare. A very
remarkable example is that in Genesis ii., 4, already mentioned,
where we find, "In the day when Jehovah Elohim made the earth and
the heavens." This day must either mean the beginning, or must
include the whole six days; most probably the latter, since the
word "made" refers not to the act of creation, properly so
called, but to the elaborating processes of the creative week;
and occurring as this does immediately after the narrative of
creation, it seems almost like an intentional intimation of the
wide import of the creative days. It has been objected, however,
that the expression "in the day" is properly a compound adverb,
having the force of "when" or "at the time." But the learned and
ingenious authors who urge this objection have omitted to
consider the relative probabilities as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
whether the adverbial use had arisen while the word <i>yom</i> meant simply a day, or
whether the use of the noun for long periods was the reason of
the introduction of such an adverbial expression. The
probabilities are in favor of the latter, for it is not likely
that men would construct an adverb referring to indefinite time
from a word denoting one of the most precisely limited portions
of time, unless that word had also a second and more unlimited
sense. Admitting, therefore, that the phrase is an adverb of
time, its use so early as the date of the composition of Genesis,
to denote a period longer than a literal day, seems to imply that
this indefinite use of the word was of high antiquity, and
probably preceded the invention of any term by which long periods
could be denoted.</p>

<p>This use of the word "day" is, however, not limited to cases of
the occurrence of the formula "in the day." The following are a
few out of many instances that might be quoted: Job xviii., 20,
"They that come after him shall be astonished at his day;" Job
xv., 32, "It shall be accomplished before his <i>time</i>;" Judges
xviii., 30, "Until the day of the captivity of the land;" Deut.
i., 39, "And your children which in that day had no knowledge of
good and evil;" Gen. xxxix., 10, "And it came to pass about that
time" (on that day). We find also abundance of such expressions
as "day of calamity," "day of distress," "day of wrath," "day of
God's power," "day of prosperity." In such passages the word is
evidently used in the sense of era or period of time, and this in
prose as well as poetry.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable passage in the Psalms, which conveys the
idea of a day of God as distinct from human or terrestrial days:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"Before the mountains were brought forth,<br />

Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.<br />
Thou turnest man to destruction,<br />
And sayest, Return, ye children of men;<br />
For a thousand years are in thy sight as yesterday when it is past,<br />
And as a watch in the night."
<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>It is a singular coincidence that the authorship of this Psalm is
attributed to Moses, and that its style and language correspond
with the songs credited to him in Deuteronomy. It is farther to
be observed that the reference is to the long periods employed in
creation as contrasted with the limited space of years allotted
to man. Its meaning, too, is somewhat obscured by the inaccurate
translation of the third line. In the original it is, "From
<i>olam</i> to <i>olam</i> thou art, O El"&mdash;that is, "from age to age."
These long ages of creation, constituting a duration to us
relatively eternal, were so protracted that even a thousand years
are but as a watch in the night. If this Psalm is rightly
attributed to the author of the first chapter of Genesis, it
seems absolutely certain that he understood his own creative days
as being <i>Olamim</i> or &aelig;ons. The same thought occurs in the Second
Epistle of Peter: "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years,
and a thousand years as one day."</p>

<p>That the other writers of the Old Testament understood the
creative days in this sense, might be inferred from the entire
absence of any reference to the work of creation as short, since
it occupied only six days. Such reference we may find in modern
writers, but never in the Scriptures. On the contrary, we receive
the impression of the creative work as long continued. Thus the
divine Wisdom says in Prov. viii., The Lord possessed me "from
the beginning of his way before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
his works of old, from everlasting, before the antiquities of the earth." So in Psalm
cxlv., God's kingdom relatively to nature and providence is a
kingdom "of all ages." In Psalm civ., which is a poetical version
of the creative work, and the oldest extant commentary on Genesis
i., it is evident that there was no idea in the mind of the
writer of a short time, but rather of long consecutive processes;
and I may remark here that the course of the narrative itself in
Genesis i., implies time for the replenishing of the earth with
various forms of being in preparation for others, exactly as in
Psalm civ.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most conclusive arguments in favor of the
length of the creative days is that furnished by the seventh day
and the institution of the Sabbath. In Genesis the seventh day is
not said to have had any evening or morning, nor is God said to
have resumed his work on any eighth day. Consequently the seventh
day of creation must be still current. Now in the fourth
commandment the Israelites are enjoined to "remember the
Sabbath-day," because "in six days God created the heavens and
the earth." Observe here that the Sabbath is to be remembered as
an institution already known. Observe farther that the
commandment is placed in the middle of the Decalogue, a solitary
piece of apparently arbitrary ritual amid the plainest and most
obvious moral duties. Observe also that the reason given&mdash;namely,
God's six days' work and seventh day's rest&mdash;seems at first sight
both far-fetched and trivial, as an argument for abstaining from
work in a seventh part of our time. How is all this to be
explained? Simply, I think, on the supposition that the Lawgiver,
and those for whom he legislated, knew beforehand the history of
creation and the fall, as we have them recorded in Genesis, and
knew that God's days are &aelig;ons. The argument is not, "God worked
on six natural days, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
rested on the seventh; do you therefore the same." Such an argument could have no moral or religious
force, more especially as it could not be affirmed that God
habitually works and rests in this way. The argument reaches far
deeper and higher. It is this. God created the world in six of
his days, and on the seventh rested, and invited man in Eden to
enter on his rest as a perpetual Sabbath of happiness. But man
fell, and lost God's Sabbath. Therefore a weekly Sabbath was
prescribed to him as a memorial of what he had lost, and a pledge
of what God has promised in the renewal of life and happiness
through our Saviour. Thus the Sabbath is the central point of the
moral law&mdash;the Gospel in the Decalogue&mdash;the connection between
God and man through the promise of redemption. It is this and
this alone that gives it its true religious significance, but is
lost on the natural-day theory. It would farther seem that this
view of the law was that of our Lord himself, and was known to
the Jews of his time, for, when blamed for healing a man on the
Sabbath, he says, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work"&mdash;an
argument whose force depended on the fact that God continues to
work in his providence throughout his long Sabbath, which has
never been broken except by man. Farther, the writer of the
Epistle to the Hebrews takes this view in arguing as to the rest
or Sabbatism that remains to the people of God. His argument
(chap. iv., 4) may be stated thus: God finished his work and
entered into his rest. Man, in consequence of the fall, failed to
do so. He has made several attempts since, but unsuccessfully.
Now Christ has finished his work, and has entered into his
Sabbath, and through him we may enter into that rest of God which
otherwise we can not attain to. This does not, it is true, refer
to the keeping of a Sabbath-day; but it implies an understanding
of the reference to God's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
olamic Sabbath, and also implies that
Christ, having entered into his Sabbatism in heaven, gives us a
warrant for the Christian Sabbath or Lord's day, which has the
same relation to Christ's present Sabbatism in heaven that the
old Sabbath had to God's rest from his work of creation.
<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>We may add to these considerations the use of the Greek term
<i>Ai[=o]n</i> in the New Testament, for what may be called
time-worlds as distinguished from space-worlds. For example, take
the expression in Heb. i., 2: "His Son, by whom he made the
worlds," or, literally, "constituted the &aelig;ons"&mdash;the long
time-worlds of the creation. For God's worlds must exist in time
as well as in space, and both may to our minds alike appear as
infinities. If, then, we find that Moses himself seems to have
understood his creative days as &aelig;ons, that the succeeding Old
Testament writers favor the same view, that this view is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
essential to the true significance of the Sabbath and the Lord's
day, and that it is sustained by Christ and his apostles, there
is surely no need for our clinging to a medi&aelig;val notion which has
no theological value, and is in opposition to the facts of
nature. On the contrary, should not even children be taught these
grand truths, and led to contemplate the great work of Him who is
from &aelig;on to &aelig;on, and to think of that Sabbatism which he prepared
for us, and which he still offers to us in the future, in
connection with the succession of worlds in time revealed by
geology, and which rivals in grandeur and perhaps exceeds in
interest the extension of worlds in space revealed by astronomy.
In truth, we should bear in mind that the great revelations of
astronomy have too much habituated us to think of space-worlds
rather than time-worlds, while the latter idea was evidently
dominant with the Biblical writers as it is also with modern
geologists. Viewed as &aelig;ons&mdash;divine days, or time-worlds&mdash;the days
of creation are thus a reality for all ages; and connect
themselves with the highest moral teachings of the Bible in
relation to the fall of man and God's plan for his restoration,
begun in this seventh &aelig;on of the world's long history, and to be
completed in that second divine Sabbatism, secured by the work of
redemption, the final "rest" of the "new heavens and new earth,"
which remains for the people of God.</p>

<p>But supposing that the inspired writer intended to say that the
world was formed in six long periods of time, could not he have
used some other word than <i>yom</i> that would have been liable to
fewer doubts. There are words which might have been used, as, for
instance, <i>eth</i>, time, season, or <i>olam</i>, age, ancient time,
eternity. The former, however, has about it a want of precision
as to its beginning and end which unfits it for this use; the
latter we have already seen is used as equivalent to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
creative <i>yom</i>. On the whole, I am unable to find any instance
which would justify me in affirming that, on the supposition that
Moses intended long periods, he could have better expressed the
idea than by the use of the word <i>yom</i>, more especially if he and
those to whom he wrote were familiar with the thought, preserved
to us in the mythology of the Hindoos and Persians, and probably
widely diffused in ancient Asia, that a working day of the
Creator immeasurably transcends a working day of man.
<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Many objections to the view which I have thus endeavored to
support from internal evidence will at once occur to every
intelligent reader familiar with the literature of this subject.
I shall now attempt to give the principal of these objections a
candid consideration.</p>

<p>(1.) It is objected that the time occupied in the work of
creation is given as a reason for the observance of the seventh
day as a Sabbath; and that this requires us to view the days of
creation as literal days. "For in six days Jehovah made the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
heaven and the earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested
on the seventh day; therefore Jehovah blessed the Sabbath-day and
sanctified it." The argument used here is, however, as we have
already seen, one of analogy. Because God rested on his seventh
day, he blessed and sanctified it, and required men in like
manner to sanctify their seventh day.
<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
 Now, if it should appear that the working day of God is not the same with the
working day of man, and that the Sabbath of God is of
proportionate length to his working day, the analogy is not
weakened; more especially as we find the same analogy extended to
the seventh year. If it should be said, God worked in the
creation of the world in six long ages, and rested on the
seventh, therefore man, in commemoration of this fact, and of his
own loss of an interest in God's rest by the fall, shall sanctify
the seventh of his working days, the argument is stronger, the
example more intelligible, than on the common supposition. This
objection is, in fact, a piece of pedantic hyperorthodoxy which
has too long been handed about without investigation. I may add
to what has been already said in reference to it, the following
vigorous thrust by Hugh Miller:
<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>"I can not avoid thinking that many of our theologians attach a
too narrow meaning to the remarkable reason attached to the
fourth commandment by the divine Lawgiver. "God rested on the
seventh day," says the text, "from all his work which he had
created and made; and God blessed the seventh day and sanctified
it." And such is the reason given in the Decalogue why man should
rest on the Sabbath-day. God
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
rested on the Sabbath-day and
sanctified it; and therefore man ought also to rest on the
Sabbath and keep it holy. But I know not where we shall find
grounds for the belief that the Sabbath-day during which God
rested was merely commensurate with one of the Sabbaths of
short-lived man&mdash;a brief period measured by a single revolution
of the earth on its axis. We have not, as has been shown, a
shadow of evidence that he resumed his work of creation on the
morrow; the geologist finds no trace of post-Adamic creation; the
theologian can tell us of none. God's Sabbath of rest may still
exist; the work of redemption may be the work of his Sabbath-day.
That elevatory process through successive acts of creation, which
engaged him during myriads of ages, was of an ordinary week-day
character; but when the term of his moral government began, the
elevatory process peculiar to it assumed the divine character of
the Sabbath. This special view appears to lend peculiar emphasis
to the reason embodied in the commandment. The collation of the
passage with the geologic record seems, as if by a species of
retranslation, to make it enunciate as its injunction, "Keep this
day, not merely as a day of memorial related to a past fact, but
also as a day of co-operation with God in the work of elevation,
in relation both to a present fact and a future purpose." "God
keeps his Sabbath," it says, "in order that he may save; keep
yours also that ye may be saved." It serves besides to throw
light on the prominence of the Sabbatical command, in a digest of
law of which no jot or tittle can pass away until the fulfillment
of all things. During the present dynasty of probation and trial,
that special work of both God and man on which the character of
the future dynasty depends is the Sabbath-day work of saving and
being saved.</p>

<p>"The common objection to that special view which regards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the days of creation as immensely protracted periods of time,
furnishes a specimen, if not of reasoning in a circle, at least
of reasoning from a mere assumption. It first takes for granted
that the Sabbath-day during which God rested was a day of but
twenty-four hours, and then argues from the supposition that, in
order to keep up the proportion between the six previous working
days and the seventh day of rest, which the reason annexed to the
fourth commandment demands, these previous days must also have
been twenty-four hours each. It would, I have begun to suspect,
square better with the ascertained facts, and be at least equally
in accordance with Scripture, to reverse the process, and argue
that because God's working days were immensely protracted
periods, his Sabbath also must be an immensely protracted period.
The reason attached to the law of the Sabbath seems to be simply
a reason of proportion: the objection to which I refer is an
objection palpably founded on considerations of proportion, and
certainly were the reason to be divested of proportion, it would
be divested also of its distinctive character as a reason. Were
it as follows, it could not be at all understood: "Six days shalt
thou labor, etc.; but on the seventh day shalt thou do no labor,
etc.; for in six immensely protracted periods of several thousand
years each did the Lord make the heavens and the earth, etc.; and
then rested during a brief day of twenty-four hours; therefore
the Lord blessed the brief day of twenty-four hours and hallowed
it." This, I repeat, would not be reason. All, however, that
seems necessary to the integrity of the reason, in its character
as such, is that the proportion of six parts to seven should be
maintained. God's periods may be periods expressed algebraically
by letters symbolical of unknown quantities, and man's periods by
letters symbolical of quantities well known; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
if God's Sabbath be equal to one of his six working days, and man's
Sabbath equal to one of his six working days, the integrity of
proportion is maintained."</p>

<p>Not only does this view of the case entirely remove the
objection, but, as we have already seen, it throws a new light on
the nature and reason of the Sabbath. No good reason, except that
of setting an example, can be assigned for God's resting for a
literal day. But if God's Sabbath of rest from natural creation
is still in progress, and if our short Sabbaths are symbolical of
the work of that great Sabbath in its present gray morning and in
its coming glorious noon, then may the Christian thank this
question, incidentally raised by geology and its long periods,
for a ray of light which shines along the whole course of
Scripture history, from the first Sabbath up to that final "rest
which remaineth for the people of God."
<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>(2.) It is objected that evening and morning are ascribed to the
first day. This has been already noticed; it may here be
considered more fully. The word evening in the original is
literally the darkening, the sunset, the dusk. Morning is the
<i>opening</i> or <i>breaking forth</i> of light&mdash;the daybreak. It must not
be denied that the explanation of these terms is attended with
some difficulty, but this is not at all lessened by narrowing the
day to twenty-four hours. The first operation of the first day
was the creation of light; next we have the Creator contemplating
his work and pronouncing it to be good; then we have the
separation of the light and darkness, previously, it is to be
presumed, intermixed; and all this without the presence of a sun
or other luminary. Which of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
operations occupied the evening, and which the morning, if the day consisted of but
twenty-four hours, beginning, according to Hebrew custom, in the
evening? Was the old primeval darkness the evening or night, and
the first breaking forth of light morning? This is almost the
only view compatible with the Hebrew civil day beginning at
evening, but it would at once lengthen the day beyond twenty-four
hours, and contradict the terms of the record. Again, were the
separated light and darkness the morning and evening? If so, why
is the evening mentioned first, contrary to the supposed facts of
the case? why, indeed, are the evening and morning mentioned at
all, since on that supposition this is merely a repetition?
Lastly, shall we adopt the ingenious expedient of dividing the
evening and morning between two days, and maintaining that the
evening belongs to the first and the morning to the second day,
which would deprive the first day of a morning, and render the
creative days, whatever their length, altogether different from
Hebrew natural or civil days? It is unnecessary to pursue such
inquiries farther, since it is evident that the terms of the
record will not agree with the supposition of natural evening and
morning. This is of itself a strong presumption against the
hypothesis of civil days, since the writer was under no necessity
so to word these verses that they would not give any rational or
connected sense on the supposition of natural evening and
morning, unless he wished to be otherwise understood.</p>

<p>But what is the meaning of evening and morning, if these days
were long periods? Here fewer difficulties meet us. First: It is
readily conceivable that the beginning and end of a period named
a day should be called evening and morning. But what made the use
of these divisions necessary or appropriate? I answer that nature
and revelation both give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
grounds at least to suspect that the
evening, or earlier part of each period, was a time of
comparative inaction, sometimes even of retrogression, and that
the latter part of each period was that of its greatest activity
and perfection. Thus, on the views stated in a former chapter, in
the first day there was a time when luminous matter, either
gradually concentrating itself toward the sun, or surrounding the
earth itself, shed a dim but slowly increasing light; then there
were day and night, the light increasing in intensity as, toward
the end of the period, the luminous matter became more and more
concentrated around the sun. So in our own seventh day, the
earlier part was a time of deplorable retrogression, and though
the Sun of Righteousness has arisen, we have seen as yet only a
dim and cloudy morning. On the theory of days of vision, as
expounded by Hugh Miller, in the "Testimony of the Rocks," in one
of his noblest passages, the evening and night fall on each
picture presented to the seer like the curtain of a stage.
Secondly: Though the explanation stated above is the most
probable, the hypothesis of long periods admits of another,
namely, that the writer means to inform us that evening and
morning, once established by the separation of light from
darkness, continued without cessation throughout the remainder of
the period&mdash;rolling from this time uninterruptedly around our
planet, like the seal cylinder over the clay.
<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
 This explanation is, however, less applicable to the following days
than to the first. Nor does this accord with the curious fact
that the seventh day, which, on the hypothesis of long periods,
is still in progress, is not said to have had an evening or
morning.</p>

<p>(3.) It is objected that the first chapter of Genesis "is not a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
poem nor a piece of oratorical diction," but a simple prosaic
narrative, and consequently that its terms must be taken in a
literal sense. In answer to this, I urge that the most truly
literal sense of the word, namely, the <i>natural</i> day, is excluded
by the terms of the narrative; and that the word may be received
as a literal day of the Creator, in the sense of one of his
working periods, without involving the use of poetical diction,
and in harmony with the wording of plain prosaic passages in
other parts of the Bible. Examples of this have already been
given. It is, however, true that, though the first chapter of
Genesis is not strictly poetical, it is thrown into a metrical
form which admits of some approach to a figurative expression in
the case of a term of this kind.</p>

<p>(4.) It has been urged that in cases where day is used to denote
period, as in the expressions "day of calamity," etc., the
adjuncts plainly show that it can not mean an ordinary day. In
answer to this, I merely refer to the internal evidence already
adduced, and to the deliberate character of the statements, in
the manner rather of the description of processes than of acts.
The difficulties attending the explanation of the evening and the
morning, and the successive creation of herbivorous and
carnivorous animals, are also strong indications which should
serve here to mark the sense, just as the context does in the
cases above referred to.</p>

<p>(5.) In Professor Hitchcock's valuable and popular "Religion of
Geology," I find some additional objections, which deserve notice
as specimens of the learned trifles which pass current among
writers on this subject, much to the detriment of sound
Scriptural literature. I give them in the words of the author. 1.
"From Genesis ii., 5 compared with Genesis i., 11 and 12, it
seems that it had not rained on the earth till the third day; a
fact altogether probable if the days were of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
twenty-four hours,
but absurd if they were long periods." It strikes us that the
absurdity here is all on the side of the short days. Why should
any prominence be given to a fact so common as the lapse of two
ordinary days without rain, more especially if a region of the
earth and not the whole is referred to, and in a document
prepared for a people residing in climates such as those of Egypt
and Palestine. But what could be more instructive and
confirmatory of the truth of the narrative than the fact that in
the two long periods which preceded the formation and clearing up
of the atmosphere or firmament, on which rain depends, and the
elevation of the dry land, which so greatly modifies its
distribution, there had been no rain such as now occurs. This is
a most important fact, and one of the marked coincidences of the
record with scientific truth. The objection, therefore, merely
shows that the ordinary day hypothesis tends to convert one of
the finest internal harmonies of this wonderful history into an
empty and, in some respects, absurd commonplace. 2. "This
hypothesis (that days are long periods) assumes that Moses
describes the creation of all the animals and plants that have
ever lived on our globe. But geology decides that the species now
living, since they are not found in the rocks any lower than man
is,
<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
 could not have been contemporaneous with those in the
rocks, but must have been created when man was&mdash;that is, in the
sixth day. Of such a creation no mention is made in Genesis; the
inference is that Moses does not describe the creation of the
existing races, but only of those that lived thousands of years
earlier, and whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
existence was scarcely suspected till modern
times. Who will admit such an absurdity?" In answer to this
objection, I remark that it is based on a false assumption. The
hypothesis of long periods does not require us to assume that
Moses notices all the animals and plants that have ever lived,
but on the contrary that he informs us only of the <i>first
appearance</i> of each great natural type in the animal and
vegetable kingdoms; just as he informs us of the first appearance
of dry land on the third day, but says nothing of the changes
which it underwent on subsequent days. Thus plants were created
on the third day, and though they may have been several times
destroyed and renewed as to genera and species, we infer that
they continued to exist in all the succeeding days, though the
inspired historian does not inform us of the fact. So also many
tribes of animals were created in the early part of the fifth
day, and it is quite unnecessary for us to be informed that these
tribes continued to exist through the sixth day. If the days were
long periods, the inspired writer could not have adopted any
other course, unless he had been instructed to write a treatise
on Pal&aelig;ontology, and to describe the fauna and flora of each
successive period with their characteristic differences. 3.
"Though there is a general resemblance between the order of
creation as described in Genesis and by geology, yet when we look
at the details of the creation of the organic world, as required
by this hypothesis, we find manifest discrepancy. Thus the Bible
represents plants only to have been created on the third day, and
animals not till the fifth; and hence at least the lower half of
the fossiliferous rocks ought to contain nothing but vegetables.
Whereas in fact the lower half of these rocks, all below the
carboniferous, although abounding in animals, contain scarcely
any plants, and these in the lowest strata fucoids or sea-weeds.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
But the Mosaic account evidently describes flowering and
seed-bearing plants, not flowerless and seedless alg&aelig;. Again,
reptiles are described in Genesis as created on the fifth day;
but reptilia and batrachians existed as early as the time when
the lower carboniferous and even old red sandstone were in course
of deposition, as their tracks on those rocks in Nova Scotia and
Pennsylvania evince.
<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
 In short, if we maintain that Moses
describes fossils as well as living species, we find discrepancy
instead of correspondence between his order of creation and that
of geology." In this objection it is assumed that the geological
history of the earth goes back to the third day of creation, or,
in other words, to the dawn of organic life. None of the greater
authorities in geology would, however, now venture to make such
an assertion, and the progress of geology is rapidly making the
contrary more and more probable. The fact is that, on the
supposition that the days of creation are long periods, the whole
series of the fossiliferous rocks belongs to the fifth and sixth
days; and that for the early plant creation of the third day, and
the great physical changes of the fourth, geology has nothing as
yet to show, except a mass of metamorphosed eozoic rocks which
have hitherto yielded no fossils except a few Protozoa; but which
contain vast quantities of carbon in the form of graphite, which
may be the remains of plants.</p>

<p>I have much pleasure in quoting, as a further answer to these
objections, the following from Professor Dana:
<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>"Accepting the account in Genesis as true, the seeming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
discrepancy between it and geology rests mainly here: Geology
holds, and has held from the first, that the progress of creation
was mainly through secondary causes; for the existence of the
science presupposes this. Moses, on the contrary, was thought to
sustain the idea of a simple fiat for each step. Grant this first
point to science, and what farther conflict is there? <i>The
question of the length of time</i>, it is replied. But not so; for
if we may take the record as allowing more than six days of
twenty-four hours, the Bible then places no limit to time. <i>The
question of the days and periods</i>, it is replied again. But this
is of little moment in comparison with the first principle
granted. Those who admit the length of time and stand upon days
of twenty-four hours have to place geological time <i>before</i> the
six days, and then assume a chaos and reordering of creation, on
the six-day and fiat principle, after a previous creation that
had operated for a long period through secondary causes. Others
take days as periods, and thus allow the required time, admitting
that creation was one in progress, a grand whole, instead of a
<i>first</i> creation excepting man by one method, and a <i>second</i> with
man by the other. This is now the remaining question between the
theologians and geologists; for all the minor points, as to the
exact interpretation of each day, do not affect the general
concordance or discordance of the Bible and science.</p>

<p>"On this point geology is now explicit in its decision, and
indeed has long been so. It proves that there was no return to
chaos, no great revolution, that creation was beyond doubt one in
its progress. We know that some geologists have taken the other
view. But it is only in the capacity of theologians, and not as
geologists. The Rev. Dr. Buckland, in placing the great events of
geology between the first and second verses of the Mosaic
account, did not pretend that there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was a geological basis for
such an hypothesis; and no writer since has ever brought forward
the first fact in geology to support the idea of a rearrangement
just before man; not one solitary fact has ever been appealed to.
The conclusion was on Biblical grounds, and not in any sense on
geological. The best that Buckland could say, when he wrote
twenty-five years since, was that geology did not absolutely
disprove such an hypothesis; and that can not be said now.</p>

<p>"It is often asserted, in order to unsettle confidence in these
particular teachings of geology, that geology is a changing
science. In this connection the remark conveys an erroneous
impression. Geology is a progressive science; and all its
progress tends to establish more firmly these two principles: (1)
The slow progress of creation through secondary causes, as
explained; and (2) the progress by periods analogous to the days
of Genesis."</p>

<p>I have, I trust, shown that the principal objections to the
lengthening of the Mosaic days into great cosmical periods are of
a character too light and superficial to deserve any regard. I
shall now endeavor to add to the internal evidence previously
given some considerations of an external character which support
this view.</p>

<p>1. The fact that the creation was progressive, that it proceeded
from the formation of the raw material of the universe, through
successive stages, to the perfection of living organisms, if we
regard the analogy of God's operations as disclosed in the
geological history of the earth and in the present course of
nature, must impress us with a suspicion that long periods were
employed in the work. God might have prepared the earth for man
in an instant. He did not choose to do so, but on the contrary
proceeded step by step; and the record he has given us does not
receive its full significance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
nor attain its full harmony with
the course of geological history, unless we can understand each
day of the creative week as including a long succession of ages.</p>

<p>2. We have, as already explained, reason to believe that the
seventh day at least has been of long duration. At the close of
the sixth, God rested from all his work of material creation, and
we have as yet no evidence that he has resumed it. Neither
theologians nor evolutionists will, I presume, desire to maintain
that any strictly creative acts have occurred in the modern
period of geology. We know that the present day, if it is the
seventh, has lasted already for at least six thousand years, and,
if we may judge from the testimony of prophecy, has yet a long
space to run, before it merges in that "new heaven and new earth"
for which all believers look, and which will constitute the first
day of an endless sabbatism.</p>

<p>3. The philosophical and religious systems of many ancient
nations afford intimations of the somewhat extensive prevalence
in ancient times of the notion of long creative periods,
corresponding to the Mosaic days. These notions, in so far as
they are based on truth, are probably derived from the Mosaic
narrative itself, or from the primitive patriarchal documents
which may have formed the basis of that narrative. They are, no
doubt, all more or less garbled versions, and can not be regarded
as of any authority, but they serve to show what was the
interpretation of the document in a very remote antiquity. I have
collected from a variety of sources the following examples:</p>

<p>The ancient mythology of Persia appears to have had six creative
periods, each apparently of a thousand years, and corresponding
very nearly with the Mosaic days.
<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
 The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
 Chaldeans had a similar system, to which in a previous chapter we have already
referred. The Etruscans possessed a history of the creation,
somewhat resembling that of the Bible, and representing the
creation as occupying six periods of a thousand years each.
<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The Egyptians believed that the world had been subject to a
series of destructions and renewals, the intervals between which
amounted to 120,000 years, or, according to other authorities, to
300,000 or 360,000 years. This system of destruction and renewal
the Egyptian priests appear to have wrought out into considerable
detail, but though important truths may be concealed under their
mysterious dogmas, it will not repay us to dwell on the fragments
that remain of them. There can be no doubt, however, that at
least the basis of the Egyptian cosmogony must have been the
common property of all the Hamite nations, of which Egypt was the
greatest and most permanent; and therefore in all probability
derived from the ideas of creation which were current not long
after the Deluge. The Egyptians appear also, as already stated,
to have had a physical cosmogony, beginning with a chaos in which
heaven and earth were mingled, and from which were evolved fiery
matters which ascended into the heavens, and moist earthy matters
which formed the earth and the sea; and from these were produced,
by the agency of solar heat, the various animals. The terms of
this cosmogony, as it is given by Diodorus Siculus, indicate the
belief of long formative periods.
<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The Hindoos have a somewhat extended, though, according to the
translations, a not very intelligible cosmogony. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
plainly, however, asserts long periods of creative work, and is
interesting as an ancient cosmogony preserved entire and without
transmission through secondary channels. The following is a
summary, in so far as I have been able to gather it, from the
translation of the Institutes of Menu by Sir W. Jones.
<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The introduction to the Institutes represents Menu as questioned
by the "divine sages" respecting the laws that should regulate
all classes or castes. He proceeds to detail the course of
creation, stating that the "Self-existing Power,
<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
undiscovered, but making this world discernible, He whom the mind
alone can perceive, whose essence eludes the external senses, who
has no visible parts, who exists from eternity, even the soul of
all being, whom no being can comprehend, shone forth in person."</p>

<p>After giving this exalted view of the Creator, the writer
proceeds to state that the Self-existent created the waters, and
then an egg, from which he himself comes forth as Brahma the
forefather of spirits. "The waters are called Nara because they
are the production of <i>Nara</i>, the spirit of God, and since they
were his first <i>Ayana</i>, or place of motion, he thence is named
<i>Narayana</i>, or moving on the waters. In the egg Brahma remained a
year, and caused the egg to divide, forming the heaven above and
the earth beneath, and the subtile ether, the eight regions, and
the receptacle of waters between. He then drew forth from the
supreme soul mind with all its powers and properties." The rest
of the account appears to be very confused, and I confess to a
great extent unintelligible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
to me. There follows, however, a
continuation of the narrative, stating that there is a succession
of seven Menus, each of whom produces and supports the earth
during his reign. It is in the account of these successive Menus
that the following statement respecting the days and years of
Brahma occurs:</p>

<p>"A day of the Gods is equal to a year. Four thousand years of the
Gods are called a Critya or Satya age. Four ages are an age of
the Gods. <i>One thousand divine ages (equal to more than four
millions of human years) are a day of Brahma the Creator.</i>
Seventy-two divine ages are one manwantara. * * * The aggregate
of four ages they call a divine age, and believe that in every
thousand such ages, or in every day of Brahma, fourteen Menus are
successively invested with the sovereignty of the earth. Each
Menu they suppose transmits his authority to his sons and
grandsons during a period of seventy-two divine ages, and such a
period they call a manwantara. Thirty such days (of the Creator),
or calpas, constitute a month of Brahma; twelve such months one
of his years, and 100 such years his age, of which they assert
that fifty years have elapsed. We are thus, according to the
Hindoos, in the first day or calpa of the fifty-first year of
Brahma's life, and in the twenty-eighth divine age of the
<i>seventh manwantara</i> of that day. In the present day of Brahma
the first Menu was named the Son of the Self-existent, and by him
the institutes of religion and civil duties are said to have been
delivered. In his time occurred a new creation called the <i>Lotos</i>
creation." Of five Menus who succeeded him, Sir William could
find little but the names, but the accounts of the seventh are
very full, and it appears that in his reign the earth was
destroyed by a flood. Sir William suggests that the first Menu
may represent the creation, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
that the seventh may be Noah.
The name Menu or Manu is equivalent to "man," and signifies "the
intelligent."
<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>In this Hindoo cosmogony we have many points of correspondence
with the Scripture narrative: for instance, the Self-existent
Creator; the agency of the Son of God and the Holy Spirit; the
absolute creation of matter; the hovering of the Spirit over the
primeval waters; the sevenfold division of the creative process;
and the idea of days of the Creator of immense duration. If we
suppose the day of Brahma in the Hindoo cosmogony to represent
the Mosaic day, then it amounts to no less than 4,320,000 years;
or if, with Sir W. Jones, we suppose the manwantara to represent
the Mosaic day, its duration will be 308,571 years; and the total
antiquity of the earth, without counting the undefined
"beginning," will be either more than twenty-five or than two
millions of years. It would be folly, however, to suppose that
these Hindoo numbers, which are probably purely conjectural, or
based on astronomical cycles, make any near approximation to the
facts of the case. The Institutes of Menu are probably in their
present form not of great antiquity, but there are other Hindoo
documents of greater age which maintain similar views, and it is
probable that the account of the creation in the Institutes is at
least an imperfect version of the original narrative as it
existed among the earliest colonists of India.
<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
 It corresponds
in many points with the oldest notions on these subjects that
remain to us in the wrecks of the mythology of Egypt and other
ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
nations, and it aids in proving that the fabulous ages
of gods and demigods in the ancient mythologies <i>are really
pre-Adamite</i>; and belong not to human history, but to the work of
creation. It also shows that the idea of long creative periods as
equivalents of the Mosaic days must, in the infancy of the
postdiluvian world, have been very widely diffused. Such evidence
is, no doubt, of small authority in the interpretation of
Scripture; but it must be admitted that serious consideration is
due to a method of interpretation which thus tends to bring the
Mosaic account into harmony with the facts of modern science, and
with the belief of almost universal antiquity, and at the same
time gives it its fullest significance and most perfect internal
symmetry of parts. It is also very interesting to note the wide
diffusion among the most ancient nations of cosmological views
identical in their main features with those of the Bible,
proving, almost beyond doubt, that these views had some common
and very ancient source, and commanded universal belief among the
primitive tribes of men.</p>

<p>I have hitherto in this part of the discussion avoided detailed
reference to what may be regarded as the "prophetic day" view of
the narrative of creation. This may be shortly stated as follows:
In the prophetical parts of Scripture the prophet sees in vision,
as in a picture or acted scene, the events that are to come to
pass, and in consequence represents years or longer periods by
days of vision. Now the revelation of the pre-Adamite past is in
its nature akin to that of the unknown future; and Moses may have
seen these wondrous events in vision&mdash;in visions of successive
days&mdash;under the guise of which he presents geological time. Some
things in the form of the narrative favor this view, and it
certainly affords the most clearly intelligible theory as to the
mode in which such a revelation may have been made to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
man. It is advocated by Kurtz, by the author of an excellent little work,
the "Harmony of the Mosaic and Geological Records," by Hugh
Miller, and more recently by Tayler Lewis. To these writers I
must refer for its more full illustration, and for the grand
pictorial view which it gives of the vision of the creative week.</p>

<p>In reviewing the somewhat lengthy train of reasoning into which
the term "day" has led us, it appears that from internal evidence
alone it can be rendered probable that the day of creation is
neither the natural nor the civil day. It also appears that the
objections urged against the doctrine of day-periods are of no
weight when properly scrutinized, and that it harmonizes with the
progressive nature of the work, the evidence of geology, and the
cosmological notions of ancient nations. I do not suppose that
this position has been incontrovertibly established; but I
believe that every serious difficulty has been removed from its
acceptance; and with this, for the present, I remain satisfied.
Every step of our subsequent progress will afford new criteria of
its truth or fallacy.</p>

<p>One further question of some interest is&mdash;What, according to the
theory of long creative days and the testimony of geology, would
be the length and precise cosmical nature of these days? With
regard to the first part of the question, we do not know the
actual value of our geological ages in time; but it is probable
that each great creative &aelig;on may have extended through millions
of years. As to the nature of the days, this may have been
determined by direct volitions of the Creator, or indirectly by
some of those great astronomical cycles which arise from the
varying eccentricity of the earth's orbit, or the diminution of
the velocity of its rotation, or by its gradual cooling.</p>

<p>With reference to these points, science has as yet little
information
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to give. Sir William Thomson has, indeed, indicated
for the time since the earth's crust first began to form a period
of between one and two hundred millions of years; but Professor
Guthrie Tait, on the other hand, argues that ten or fifteen
millions of years are probably sufficient,
<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
 and Lockyer has suggested an hypothesis of successive rekindlings of the solar
heat which might give a more protracted time than that of
Thomson. Some of the hypotheses of derivation current, but which
are based rather on philosophical speculation than on scientific
fact, would also require a longer time than that allowed by
Thomson; and it is to be regretted that some geologists, by
giving credence to such hypotheses of derivation, and by loose
reasoning on the time required for the denudation and deposition
of rocks, have been induced to commit themselves to very
extravagant estimates as to geological time. On the whole, it is
evident that only the most vague guesses can at present be based
on the facts in our possession, though the whole time required
has unquestionably been very great, the deposition of the series
of stratified rocks probably requiring at least the greater part
of the minimum time allowed by Thomson.
<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>As to the cosmical nature of the periods, while some geologists
appear to regard the whole of geological time as a continuous
evolution without any breaks, it is evidently more in accordance
with facts to hold that there have been cycles of repose and
activity succeeding each other, and that these have been of
different grades. In the succession of deposits it is plain that
periods of depression and upheaval common to all the continental
masses have succeeded each other at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
somewhat regular intervals,
and that within these periods there have been alternations of
colder and warmer climates. These, however, are not equal to the
creative days of our record, for they are greatly more numerous.
They are but the vastly protracted hours of these almost endless
days. Beyond and above these there is another grade of geological
period, marked not by mere gradual elevation and depression of
the continental areas, but by vast crumplings of the earth's
crust and enormous changes of level. Such a great movement
unquestionably closed the Eozoic period of geology. Another of
less magnitude occurred in what is termed the Permian age at the
end of the Pal&aelig;ozoic. A third terminated the Mesozoic age, and
introduced the Tertiary or Kainozoic. Perhaps we should reckon
the glacial age, though characterized by far less physical change
than the others, as a fourth. The possible physical causes which
have been suggested for such greater disturbances are the
collapses of the crust in equatorial regions, which may be
supposed to have resulted at long intervals of time, from the
gradual retardation of the earth's rotation caused by the tides,
or the similar collapses and other changes due to the shrinkages
of the earth's interior caused by its gradual cooling, and to the
unequal deposition of material by water on different parts of its
surface.
<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
 The more full discussion of these points belongs,
however, to a future chapter.</p>

<p>These greater movements of the crust, would, as already stated,
coincide to some extent with the later creative days in the
manner indicated below:</p>

<p>The question recurs&mdash;Why are God's days so long? He is not like
us, a being of yesterday. He is "from Olam to Olam," and even in
human history one day is with him as a thousand years; and we who
live in these later days of the world know full well how slow the
march of his plan has been even in human history. We shall know
in the endless ages of a future eternity that even to us these
long creative days may at last become but as watches in the
night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">THE ATMOSPHERE.</span><br /><br />

<span style="font-size:50%;">"And God said, Let there be an expanse between the waters;
and let it separate the waters from the waters. And God made the expanse, and separated
the waters which are under the expanse from the waters which are over the expanse: and
it was so. And God called the expanse Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the
second day."&mdash;Genesis i. 6-8.</span></h2>


<p>At the opening of the period to which we are now introduced the
earth was covered by the waters, and these were in such a
condition that there was no distinction between the seas and the
clouds. No atmosphere separated them, or, in other words, dense
fogs and mists everywhere rested on the surface of the primeval
ocean. To understand as far as possible the precise condition of
the earth's surface at this period, it will be necessary to
notice the present constitution of the atmosphere, especially in
its relations to aqueous vapor.</p>

<p>The regular and constant constituents of the atmosphere are the
elements oxygen and nitrogen, which, at the temperature and
pressure existing on the surface of our globe, are permanently
aeriform or gaseous. Beside these gases, the air always contains
a quantity of the vapor of water in a perfectly aeriform and
transparent condition. This vapor is not, however, permanently
gaseous. At all temperatures below 212 degrees it tends to the
liquid state; and its elastic force, which preserves its
particles in the separated state of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
vapor, increases or
diminishes at a more rapid rate than the increase or diminution
of temperature. Hence the quantity of vapor that can be suspended
in clear air depends on the temperature of the air itself. As the
temperature of the air rises, its power of sustaining vapor
increases more rapidly than its temperature; and as the
temperature of the air falls, the elastic force of its contained
vapor diminishes in a greater ratio, until it can exist as an
invisible vapor no longer, but becomes condensed into minute
bubbles or globules, forming cloud, mist, or rain. Two other
circumstances operate along with these properties of air and
vapor. The heat radiated from the earth's surface causes the
lower strata of air to be, in ordinary circumstances, warmer than
the higher; and, on the other hand, warm air, being lighter than
that which is colder, the warm layer of air at the surface
continually tends to rise through and above the colder currents
immediately over it. Let us consider the operation of the causes
thus roughly sketched in a column of calm air. The lower portion
becomes warmed, and if in contact with water takes up a quantity
of its vapor proportioned to the temperature, or in ordinary
circumstances somewhat less than this proportion. It then tends
to ascend, and as it rises and becomes mixed with colder air it
gradually loses its power of sustaining moisture, and at a height
proportioned to the diminution of temperature and the quantity of
vapor originally contained in the air, it begins to part with
water, which becomes condensed in the form of mist or cloud; and
the surface at which this precipitation takes place is often
still more distinctly marked when two masses or layers of air at
different temperatures become intermixed; in which case, on the
principle already stated, the mean temperature produced is unable
to sustain the vapor proper to the two extremes, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
moisture is
precipitated. It thus happens that layers of cloud accumulate in
the atmosphere, while between them and the surface there is a
stratum of clear air. Fogs and mists are in the present state of
nature exceptional appearances, depending generally on local
causes, and showing what the world might be but for that
balancing of temperature and the elastic force of vapor which
constitutes the atmospheric firmament.
<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The quantity of water thus suspended over the earth is enormous.
"When we see a cloud resolve itself into rain, and pour out
thousands of gallons of water, we can not comprehend how it can
float in the atmosphere."
<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
 The explanation is&mdash;1st, the
extreme levity of the minute globules, which causes them to fall
very slowly; 2d, they are supported by currents of air,
especially by the ascending currents developed both in still air
and in storms; 3dly, clouds are often dissolving on one side and
forming on another. A cloud gradually descending may be
dissolving away by evaporation at the base as fast as new matter
is being added above. On the other hand, an ascending warm
current of air may be constantly depositing moisture at the base
of the cloud, and this may be evaporating under the solar rays
above. In this case a cloud is "merely the visible form of an
aerial space, in which certain processes are at the moment in
equilibrium, and all the particles in a state of upward
movement."
<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
 But so soon as condensation markedly exceeds
evaporation, rain falls, and the atmosphere discharges its vast
load of water&mdash;how vast we may gather from the fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
that the
waters of all the rivers are but a part of the overflowings of
the great atmospheric reservoir. "God binds up the waters in his
thick cloud, and the cloud is not rent under them." It is thus
that the terrestrial waters are divided into those above and
those below that expanse of clear air in which we live and move,
exempt from the dense, dark mists of the earth's earlier state,
yet enjoying the benefits of the cloudy curtain that veils the
burning sun, and of the cloudy reservoirs that drop down rain to
nourish every green thing.</p>

<p>We have no reason to suppose that the laws which regulate
mixtures of gases and vapors did not prevail in the period in
question. It is probable that these laws are as old as the
creation of matter; but the condition of our earth up to the
second day must have been such as prevented them from operating
as at present. Such a condition might possibly be the result of
an excessive evaporation occasioned by internal heat. The
interior of the earth still remains in a heated state, and
includes large subterranean reservoirs of melted rock, as is
proved by the increase of temperature in deep mines and borings,
and by the widely extended phenomena of hot springs and volcanic
action. At the period in question the internal temperature of the
earth was probably vastly greater than at present, and perhaps
the whole interior of the globe may have been in a state of
igneous fluidity. At the same time the external solid crust may
have been thin, and it was not fractured and thickened in places
by the upheaval of mountain chains or the deposition of great and
unequal sheets of sediment; for, as I may again remind the
reader, the primitive chaos did not consist of a confused
accumulation of rocky masses, but the earth's crust must then
have been more smooth and unbroken than at any subsequent period.
This being the internal condition of the earth, it is quite
conceivable,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
without any violation of the existing laws of
nature, that the waters of the ocean, warmed by internal heat,
may have sent up a sufficient quantity of vapor to keep the lower
strata of air in a constant state of saturation, and to occasion
an equally constant precipitation of moisture from the colder
strata above. This would merely be the universal operation of a
cause similar to that which now produces fogs at the northern
limit of the Atlantic Gulf Stream, and in other localities where
currents of warm water flow under or near to cooler air. Such a
state of things is more conceivable in a globe covered with
water, and consequently destitute of the dry and powerfully
radiating surfaces which land presents, and receiving from
without the rays, not of a solar orb, but of a comparatively
feeble and diffused luminous ether. The continued action of these
causes would gradually cool the earth's crust and its incumbent
waters, until the heat from without preponderated over that from
within, when the result stated in the text would be effected.</p>

<p>The statements of our primitive authority for this condition of
the earth might also be accounted for on the supposition that the
permanently gaseous part of the atmosphere did not at the period
in question exist in its present state, but that it was on the
second day actually elaborated and caused to take its place in
separating the atmospheric from the oceanic waters. The first is
by far the more probable view; but we may still apply to such
speculations the words of Elihu, the friend of Job:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"Stand still and consider the wonderful works of God.<br />
Dost thou know when God disposes them,<br />
And the lightning of his cloud shines forth?<br />
Dost thou know the poising of the dark clouds,<br />
The wonderful works of the Perfect in knowledge?"</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
We may now consider the words in which this great improvement in
the condition of the earth is recorded. The Hebrew term for the
atmosphere is <i>Rakiah</i>, literally, something expanded or beaten
out&mdash;an expanse. It is rendered in our version "firmament," a
word conveying the notion of support and fixity, and in the
Septuagint "<i>Stereoma</i>," a word having a similar meaning. The
idea conveyed by the Hebrew word is not, however, that of
<i>strength</i>, but of <i>extent</i>; or as Milton&mdash;the most accurate of
expositors of these words&mdash;has it:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;font-size:90%;">"The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,<br />
Transparent, elemental air, diffused<br />
In circuit to the uttermost convex<br />
Of this great round."</p>

<p>That this was really the way in which this word was understood by
the Hebrews appears from several passages of the Bible. Job says
of God, "Who alone <i>spreadeth</i> out the heavens."
<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
 David, in the 104th Psalm, which is a poetical paraphrase of the history of
creation, speaks of the Creator as "<i>stretching</i> out the heavens
as a curtain." In later writers, as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
similar expressions occur. The notion of a solid or arched
firmament was probably altogether remote from the minds of these
writers. Such beliefs may have prevailed at the time when the
Septuagint translation was made, but I have no hesitation in
affirming that no trace of them can be found in the Old
Testament. In proof of this, I may refer to some of the passages
which have been cited as affording the strongest instances of
this kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
"accommodation." In Exodus xxiv., 10, we are told,
"And they saw the God of Israel, and under his feet as it were a
paved work of sapphire, and as it were the heaven itself in its
clearness." This is evidently a comparison of the pavement seen
under the feet of Jehovah to a sapphire in its color, and to the
heavens in its transparency. The intention of the writer is not
to give information respecting the heavens, or to liken them
either to a pavement or a sapphire; all that we can infer is that
he believed the heavens to be clear or transparent. Job mentions
the "pillars of heaven," but the connection shows that this is
merely a poetical expression for lofty mountains. The earthquake
causes these pillars of heaven to "tremble." We are informed in
the book of Job that God "ties up his waters in his thick cloud,
and the cloud is not rent under them." We are also told of the
"treasures of snow and the treasures of hail," and rain is called
the "bottles of heaven," and is said to be poured out of the
"lattices of heaven." I recognize in all these mere poetical
figures, not intended to be literally understood. Some learned
writers wish us to believe that the intention of the Bible in
these places is actually to teach that the clouds are contained
in skin bottles, or something similar, and that they are emptied
through hatches in a solid firmament. To found such a belief,
however, on a few figurative statements, seems ridiculous,
especially when we consider that the writers of the Scriptures
show themselves to be well acquainted with nature, and would not
be likely on any account to deviate so far from the ordinary
testimony of the senses; more especially as by doing so they
would enable every unlettered man who has seen a cloud gather on
a mountain's brow or dissolve away before increasing heat to
oppose the evidence of his senses to their statements, and
perhaps to reject them with scorn as a barefaced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
imposture. But, lastly, we are triumphantly directed to the question of Elihu in
his address to Job:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;font-size:90%;">"Hast thou with him stretched out the sky,<br />
Which is firm and like a molten mirror?"</p>

<p>But the word translated sky here is not "<i>rakiah</i>," or
"<i>shamayim</i>," but another signifying the <i>clouds</i>, so that we
should regard Elihu as speaking of the apparent firmness or
stability, and the beautiful reflected tints of the clouds. His
words may be paraphrased thus: "Hast thou aided Him in spreading
out those clouds, which appear so stable and self-sustaining, and
so beautifully reflect the sunlight?"
<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
 The above passages form
the only authority which I can find in the Scriptures for the
doctrine of a solid firmament, which may therefore be
characterized as a modern figment of men more learned in books
but less acquainted with nature than the Scripture writers. As a
contrast to all such doctrines I may quote the sublime opening of
the poetical account of creation in Psalm civ., which we may also
take here as elsewhere as the oldest and most authoritative
commentary on the first chapter of Genesis:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;font-size:90%;">"Bless the Lord, O my soul!<br />
O Lord, my God, thou art very great:<br />
Thou art clothed with honor and majesty,<br />
Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment,<br />
Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain (of a tent),<br />
<i>Who layest the beams of thy chambers in the waters,<br />
Who makest the clouds thy chariots,<br />
Who walkest upon the wings of the wind</i>."</p>

<p>The waters here are those above the firmament, the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of this
part of the Psalm being occupied with the heavens; and there is
no place left for the solid firmament, of which the writer
evidently knew nothing. He represents God as laying his chambers
on the waters, instead of on the supposed firmament, and as
careering in cloudy chariots on the wings of the wind, instead of
over a solid arch. For all the above reasons, we conclude that
the "expanse" of the verses under consideration was understood by
the writers of the book of God to be <i>aerial</i>, not <i>solid</i>; and
the "establishment of the clouds above," as it is finely called
in Proverbs, is the effect of those meteorological laws to which
I have already referred, and which were now for the first time
brought into operation by the divine Legislator. The Hebrew
theology was not of a kind to require such expedients as that of
solid heavenly arches; it recurred at once to the will&mdash;the
decree&mdash;of Jehovah; and was content to believe that through this
efficient cause the "rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not
full," for "to the place whence the rivers came, thither they
return again," through the agency of those floating clouds, "the
waters above the heavens," which "pour down rain according to the
vapor thereof."</p>

<p>God called the expanse "Heaven." In former chapters we have
noticed that heaven in the popular speech of the Hebrews, as in
our own, had different meanings, applying alike to the cloudy,
the astral, and the spiritual heavens. The Creator here sanctions
its application to the aerial expanse; and accordingly throughout
the Scriptures it is used in this way; <i>rakiah</i> occurs very
rarely, as if it had become nearly obsolete, or was perhaps
regarded as a merely technical or descriptive term. The divine
sanction for the use of the term heaven for the atmosphere is, as
already explained,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to indicate that this popular use is not to
interfere with its application to the whole universe beyond our
earth in verse 1st.</p>

<p>The poetical parts of the Bible, and especially the book of Job,
which is probably the most ancient of the whole, abound in
references to the atmosphere and its phenomena. I may quote a few
of these passages, to enable us to understand the views of these
subjects given in the Bible, and the meaning attached to the
creation of the atmosphere, in very ancient periods. In Job, 38th
chapter, we have the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;font-size:90%;">"In what way is the lightning distributed,<br />
And how is the east wind spread abroad over the earth?<br />
Who hath opened a channel for the pouring rain,<br />
Or a way for the thunder-flash?<br />
To cause it to rain on the land where no man is,<br />
In the desert where no one dwells;<br />
To saturate the desolate and waste ground,<br />
And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth."</p>

<p>Here we have the unequal and unforeseen distribution of
thunder-storms, beyond the knowledge and power of man, but under
the absolute control of God, and designed by him for beneficent
purposes. Equally fine are some of the following lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;font-size:90%;">"Dost thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,<br />
That abundance of waters may cover thee?<br />
Dost thou send forth the lightnings, and they go,<br />
And say unto thee, Here are we?<br />
Who can number the clouds by wisdom,<br />
Or cause the bottles of heaven to empty themselves?<br />
When the dust groweth into mire,<br />
And the clods cleave fast together?"</p>

<p>In the 36th and 37th chapters of the same book we have a grand
description of atmospheric changes in their relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to man and his works. The speaker is Elihu, who in this ancient book most
favorably represents the knowledge of nature that existed at a
time probably anterior to the age of Moses&mdash;a knowledge far
superior to that which we find in the works of many modern poets
and expositors, and accompanied by an intense appreciation of the
grandeur and beauty of natural objects:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;font-size:90%;">"For he draweth up the drops of water,<br />

To execute his pleasure on the face of the world;<br />
Whether for correction, for his land, or for mercy,<br />
He causeth it to come.<br />
Hearken unto this, O Job,<br />
Stand still and consider the wonderful works of God.<br />
Dost thou know when God disposes these things,<br />
And the lightning of his cloud flashes forth?<br />
Dost thou know the poising of the clouds,<br />
The wonderful work of the Perfect in knowledge?<br />
When thy garments become warm<br />
When he quieteth the earth by the south wind;<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
It would not be easy to find, in the poetry of any nation or
time, a description of so many natural phenomena, so fine in
feeling or truthful in delineation. It should go far to dispel
the too prevalent ideas of early Oriental ignorance, and should
lead to a more full appreciation of these noble pictures of
nature, unsurpassed in the literature of any people or time. I
trust that the previous illustrations are sufficient to show, not
only that the <i>stereoma</i>, or solid firmament of the Septuagint,
is not to be found in Scripture, but that the positive doctrine
of the Bible on the subject is of a very different character. For
instance, in the above extract from the book of Job, Elihu speaks
of the poising or suspension of the clouds as inscrutable, and
tells us that God draws up water into the clouds, and pours down
rain according to the vapor thereof; he also speaks of the clouds
as being scattered before the brightness of the sun; and notices,
in truthful as well as exalted language, the nature and
succession of the lightning's flash, the thunder, and the
precipitation of rain that follows. Solomon also informs us that
the "establishment of the clouds above" is due to the law or will
of Jehovah. Finally, in this connection, the divine sanction
given to the use of the term heaven for the atmosphere may in
itself be regarded as an intimation that no definite barrier
separates our film of atmosphere from the boundless abyss of
heaven without.</p>

<p>Of this period natural science gives us no intimation. In the
earliest geological epochs organic life, dry land, and an
atmosphere already existed. At the period now under consideration
the two former had not been called into existence, and the latter
was in process of elaboration from the materials
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of the primeval deep. If the formation of the atmosphere in its existing
conditions was, as already hinted, a result of the gradual
cooling of the earth, then this period must have been of great
length, and the action of the heated waters on the crust of the
globe may have produced thick layers of detrital matter destined
to form the first soils of the succeeding &aelig;on. We know nothing,
however, of these primitive strata, and most of them must have
been removed by denuding agencies in succeeding periods, or
restored by subterranean heat to the crystalline state. The
events and results of this day may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p>"At the commencement of the period the earth was enveloped by a
misty or vaporous mantle. In its progress those relations of air
and vapor which cause the separation of the clouds from the earth
by a layer of clear air, and the varied alternations of sunshine
and rain, were established. At the close of the period the newly
formed atmosphere covered a universal ocean; and there was
probably a very regular and uniform condition of the atmospheric
currents, and of the processes of evaporation and condensation."</p>

<p>But while we must affirm that no idea of a solid atmospheric
vault can be detected in the Bible, and while we may also affirm
that such an idea would have been altogether foreign to its tone,
which invariably refers all things not to secondary machinery,
but to the will and fiat of the Supreme, we must not forget that
a most important moral purpose was to be served by the assertion
of the establishment of the atmospheric expanse. Among all
nations the phenomena of the atmosphere have had important
theological and mythological relations. The ever-changing and
apparently capricious aspects of the atmosphere and its clouds,
the terrible effects of storms, and the balmy influence of
sunshine and calm, deeply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
impress the minds of simple and
superstitious men, and this all the more that in their daily life
and expeditions they are constantly subjected to the effects of
atmospheric vicissitudes. Hence the greatest gods of all the
ancient nations are weather-gods&mdash;rulers of the atmospheric
heavens&mdash;displaying their anger in the thunder-storm and tornado.
It is likely that in most cases, as in many barbarous tribes of
modern times, these weather-gods were malevolent beings
contending against the genial influences of the heavenly Sun-god;
but in nearly every case their supposed practical importance has
elevated them, as in the case of the Olympian Zeus, the
Scandinavian Thor, and the American Hurakon, to the place of
supreme divinity. This was one of the superstitions which the
Hebrew monotheism had to overcome. Hence the atmosphere is
affirmed to be under Jehovah's law, and all its phenomena are
attributed to his power. The value of this as cutting at the root
of the most widespread superstitions it is easy to understand,
and it has a farther value in teaching that even the apparently
unstable and capricious air is a thing established from the first
and amenable to the ordinance of God. How difficult it has been
to eradicate superstitious views of the atmosphere may be learned
from the fact that St. Paul, in writing to the enlightened
citizens of Ephesus, could speak of the power which the heathen
worshipped as the "Prince of the powers of the air," and it is
also evidenced by the abundant notions of this kind which have
survived from the Middle Ages among the more ignorant part of the
people even in lands called Christian.</p>

<p>While, however, the Bible affirms the atmosphere to be subject to
law, it does not carry this into the domain of physical
necessity, and affirm with some modern materialistic philosophers
that it is useless to pray for rain. It is God who gives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, and what he gives he can
withhold. Perhaps no part of our subject can better than this
illustrate the rational distinction between a mere physical
fatalism, or a mere superstitious fear of capricious nature, and
that belief in a divine Lawgiver which lies between these
extremes. Modern science may smile at the poor Indian, who in his
fear invokes Hurakon or Tlaloc or the terrible Thunder-bird, and
may even despise that nobler worship of the great Phoenician
Sun-god, the source and fountain of all light and life; against
which, though it was the grandest of all the old idolatries,
Elijah waged war to the death. But may it not equally deride the
faith of Elijah himself, when, after three years of drought, he
prayed in the sight of assembled Israel for rain? It may do so if
physical law amounts to an invariable necessity, and if there is
no supreme Will behind it. But if natural laws are the expression
of the divine will, if these laws are multiform and complicated
in their relations, and regulate vastly varied causes interacting
with each other, and if the action and welfare of man come within
the scope of these laws, then there is nothing irrational in the
supposition that God, without any capricious or miraculous
intervention, may have so correlated the myriad adjustments of
his creation as that, while it is his usual rule that rain falls
alike on the evil and on the good, he may make its descent at
particular times and places to depend on the needs and requests
of his own children. In truth the belief in law is essential to
the philosophical conception of prayer. If the universe were a
mere chaos of chances, or if it were a result of absolute
necessity, there would be no place for intelligent prayer; but if
it is under the control of a Lawgiver, wise and merciful, not a
mere manager of material machinery, but a true Father of all,
then we can go to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
such a being with our requests, not in the
belief that we can change his great plans, or that any advantage
could result from this if it were possible, but that these plans
may be made in his boundless wisdom and love to meet our
necessities. There is also in the Bible the farther promise that,
if we are truly the children of God, regulating our conduct by
his will and enlightened by his spirit, we shall know how to pray
for what is in accordance with his divine purpose, and how to
receive with gladness whatever he sees fit to give. While,
therefore, the Biblical doctrine as to natural law emancipates us
from fears of angry storm-demons, it draws us near to a heavenly
Father, whose power is above all the tempests of earth, and who,
while ruling by law, has regulated all things in conformity with
the higher law of love. When God had made the atmosphere, he saw
that it was good, and the highest significance is given to this
by the consideration that God is love. The position of the Bible
is thus the true mean between superstitions at once unhappy and
debasing, and a materialistic infidelity that would reduce the
universe to a dead, remorseless machine, in which we must
struggle for a precarious existence till we are crushed between
its wheels.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">THE DRY LAND AND THE FIRST PLANTS.</span><br /></h2>

<p style="font-size:70%;text-align:left;text-indent:3em;font-weight:bold;">
"And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be
gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  And God
called the dry land earth, and the gathering of waters called he seas; and God
saw that it was good.</p>

<p style="font-size:70%;text-align:left;text-indent:3em;font-weight:bold;">
"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the springing herb, the herb bearing seed,
and the fruit tree yielding fruit, after its kind, whose seed is in it on the earth:
and it was so. And the earth brought forth the tender herb, the herb yielding seed,
and the tree bearing fruit whose seed is in it, after its kind; and God saw that it
was good."&mdash;Genesis i., 10, 11.</p>

<p>These are events sufficiently simple and intelligible in their
general character. Geology shows us that the emergence of the dry
land must have resulted from the elevation of parts of the bed of
the ancient universal ocean, and that the agent employed in such
changes is the bending and crumpling of the outer crust of the
earth, caused by lateral pressure, and operating either in a slow
and regular manner or by sudden paroxysms. It farther informs us
that the existing continents consist of stratified or bedded
masses, more or less inclined, fissured and irregularly elevated,
and usually supported by crystalline rocks which have been
produced among them, or forced up beneath or through them by
internal agencies, and which truly constitute the pillars and
foundations of the earth. These elevations, it is true, were
successive, and belong to different periods; but the appearance
of the first dry land is that intended here.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
The elevation of the dry land is more frequently referred to in
Scripture than any other cosmological fact; and while all have
been misapprehended, the statements on this subject have been
even more unjustly dealt with than others. In the text, the word
"earth" (<i>aretz</i>
<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
) is, by divine sanction, narrowed in meaning
to the dry land; but while some expositors are quite willing to
restrict it to this, or even a more limited sense, in the first
and second verses of this chapter, almost the only verses in the
Bible where the terms of the narrative make such a restriction
inadmissible, they are equally ready to understand it as meaning
the whole globe in places where the explanatory clause in the
verse now under consideration teaches us that we should
understand the land only, as distinguished from the sea. I may
quote some of these passages, and note the views they give;
always bearing in mind that, after the intimation here given, we
must understand the term "earth" as applying <i>only to the
continents</i> or <i>dry land</i>, unless where the context otherwise
fixes the meaning. We may first turn to Psalm civ.:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"Thou laidst the foundations of the earth,<br />
That it should never be removed;<br />
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment;<br />
The waters stood above the mountains;<br />
At thy rebuke they fled;<br />
At the sound of thy thunder they hasted away;<br />
Mountains ascended, valleys descended<br />
To the place thou hast appointed for them:<br />
Thou hast appointed them bounds that they may not pass,<br />
That they return not again to cover the earth."</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
The position of these verses in this "the hymn of creation"
leaves no doubt that they refer to the events we are now
considering. I have given above the literal reading of the line
that refers to the elevation of mountains and subsidence of
valleys; admitting, however, that the grammatical construction
gives an air of probability to the rendering in our version,
"they go up by the mountains, they go down by the valleys,"
which, on the other hand, is rendered very improbable by the
sense. In whichever sense we understand this line, the picture
presented to us by the Psalmist includes the elevation of the
mountains and continents, the subsidence of the waters into their
depressed basins, and the firm establishment of the dry land on
its rocky foundations, the whole accompanied by a feature not
noticed in Genesis&mdash;the voice of God's thunder&mdash;or, in other
words, electrical and volcanic explosions. The following
quotations refer to the same subject:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"Before the mountains were settled,<br />
Before the hills was I (the Wisdom of God) brought forth;<br />
While as yet he had not made the earth,<br />
Nor the plains, nor the higher parts of the habitable world.<br />
When he gave the sea his decree<br />
That the waters should not pass his limits,<br />
When he determined the foundations of the earth."<br />
<span style="margin-left:15em;">&mdash;Proverbs viii., 25.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 7em;font-size:90%;">"Thou hast established the earth, and it endureth,<br />
According to thy decrees they continue this day,<br />
For all are thy servants."<br />
<span style="margin-left:15em;">&mdash;Psalm cxix., 90.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 9em;font-size:90%;">"Who shaketh the earth out of its place,<br />
And its pillars tremble."<br />
<span style="margin-left:15em;">&mdash;Job ix., 6.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 7em;font-size:90%;">"Where wast thou when I founded the earth?<br />
Declare, if thou hast knowledge.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Who hath fixed the proportion thereof, if thou knowest?<br />
Who stretched the line upon it?<br />
Upon what are its foundations settled?<br />
Or who laid its corner-stone,<br />
When the morning stars sang together,<br />
And all the sons of God shouted for joy?<br />
Who shut up the sea with doors<br />
In its bursting forth as from the womb?<br />
When I made the cloud its garment,<br />
And swathed it in thick darkness,<br />
I measured out for it my limit,<br />
And fixed its bars and doors;<br />
And said, Thus far shalt thou come, but no farther,<br />
And here shall thy proud waves be stayed."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&mdash;Job xxxviii., 4.</span></p>

<p>In these passages the foundation of the earth at first, as well
as the shaking of its pillars by the earthquake, are connected
with what we usually call natural law&mdash;the decree of the
Almighty&mdash;the unchanging arrangements of an unchangeable Creator,
whose "hands formed the dry land."
<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
 This is the ultimate cause
not only of the elevation of the land, but of all other natural
things and processes. The naturalist does not require to be
informed that the details, in so far as they are referred to in
the above passages, are perfectly in accordance with what we know
of the nature and support of continental masses. Geological
observation and mathematical calculation have in our day combined
their powers to give clear views of the manner in which the
fractured strata of the earth are wedged and arched together, and
supported by internal igneous masses upheaved from beneath, and
subsequently cooled and hardened. A general view of these facts
which we have learned from scientific inquiry, the Hebrews
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
gleaned with nearly as much precision from the short account of
the elevation of the land in Genesis, and from the later comments
of their inspired poets. From the same source our own great poet,
Milton, learned these cosmical facts, before the rise of geology,
and expressed them in unexceptionable terms:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 7em;font-size:90%;"><span style="margin-left:5em;">"The mountains huge appear</span><br />
Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave<br />
Into the clouds, their tops ascend the sky.<br />
So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low<br />
Down sunk a hollow bottom, broad and deep,<br />
Capacious bed of waters."</p>

<p>In further illustration of the opinions of the Scripture writers
respecting the nature of the earth, and the disturbances to which
it is liable, I quote the following passages. The first is from
the magnificent description of Jehovah descending to succor his
people amid the terrors of the earthquake, the volcano, and the
thunder-storm, in Psalm xviii.:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"Then shook and trembled the earth,<br />
The foundations of the hills moved and were shaken,<br />
Because he was angry.<br />
Smoke went up from his nostrils,<br />
Fire from his mouth devoured,<br />
Coals were kindled by it.<br />
Then were seen the channels of the waters,<br />
And the foundations of the world were discovered,<br />
At thy rebuke&mdash;O Jehovah&mdash;<br />
At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils."</p>

<p>In another place in the Psalms we find volcanic action thus
tersely sketched:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;font-size:90%;text-indent:-.5em;">"He looketh on the earth and it trembleth,<br />
He toucheth the hills and they smoke."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;Psalm civ., 32.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Perhaps the most remarkable discourse on this subject in the
whole Bible is that in Job xxviii., in which mining operations
are introduced as an illustration of the difficulty of obtaining
true wisdom. This passage is interesting both from its extreme
antiquity, and the advancement in knowledge and practical skill
which it indicates. It presents, however, many difficulties; and
its details have almost entirely lost their true significance in
our common English version:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"Surely there is a vein for silver,<br />
And a place for the gold which men refine;<br />
Iron is taken from the earth,<br />
And copper is molten from the ore.<br />

For the stones of darkness and the shadow of death.<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
He restraineth the streams from trickling,<br />
And bringeth the hidden thing to light.<br />
But where shall wisdom be found,<br />
And where is the place of understanding?"</p>

<p>This passage, incidentally introduced, gives us a glimpse of the
knowledge of the interior of the earth and its products, as it
existed in an age probably anterior to that of Moses. It brings
before us the repositories of the valuable metals and gems&mdash;the
mining operations, apparently of some magnitude and difficulty,
undertaken in extracting them&mdash;and the wonderful structure of the
earth itself, green and productive at the surface, rich in
precious metals beneath, and deeper still the abode of intense
subterranean fires. The only thing wanting to give completeness
to the picture is some mention of the fossil remains buried in
the earth; and, as the main thought is the eager and successful
search for useful minerals, this can hardly be regarded as a
defect. The application of all this is finer than almost any
thing else in didactic poetry. Man can explore depths of the
earth inaccessible to all other creatures, and extract thence
treasures of inestimable value; yet, after thus exhausting all
the natural riches of the earth, he too often lacks that highest
wisdom which alone can fit him for the true ends of his spiritual
being. How true is all this, even in our own wonder-working days!
A poet of to-day could scarcely say more of subterranean wonders,
or say it more truthfully and beautifully; nor could he arrive at
a conclusion more pregnant with the highest philosophy than the
closing words:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;font-size:90%;">"The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;<br />
And to depart from evil is understanding."

The emergence of the dry land is followed by a repetition of the
approval of the Creator. "God saw that it was good." To our view
that primeval dry land would scarcely have seemed good. It was a
world of bare, rocky peaks, and verdureless valleys&mdash;here active
volcanoes, with their heaps of scori&aelig; and scarcely cooled lava
currents&mdash;there vast mudflats, recently upheaved from the bottom
of the waters&mdash;nowhere even a blade of grass or a clinging
lichen. Yet it was good in the view of its Maker, who could see
it in relation to the uses for which he had made it, and as a fit
preparatory step to the new wonders he was soon to introduce.
Then too, as we are informed in Job xxxviii., "The morning stars
sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy." We also,
when we think of the beautiful variety of the terrestrial
surface, the character and composition of its soils, the variety
of climate and exposure resulting from its degrees of elevation,
the arrangements for the continuance of springs and streams, and
many other beneficial provisions connected with the merely
mechanical arrangements of the dry land, may well join in the
tribute of praise to the All-wise Creator. There is, however, a
farther thought suggested by the approval of the great Artificer.
In this wondrous progress of creation, it seems as if every thing
at first was in its best estate. No succeeding state could
parallel the unbroken symmetry of the earth in the fluid and
vaporous condition of the "deep." Before the elevation of the
land, the atmospheric currents and the deposition of moisture
must have been surpassingly regular. The first dry land may have
presented crags and peaks and ravines and volcanic cones in a
more marvellous and perfect manner than any succeeding
continents&mdash;even as the dry and barren moon now, in this respect,
far surpasses the earths. In the progress of organic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
life, geology gives similar indications, in the variety and magnitude
of many animal types on their first introduction; so that this
may very possibly be a law of creation.</p>

<p>During the emergence of the first dry land, large quantities of
detrital matter must have been deposited in the waters, and in
part elevated into land. All of these beds would, probably, be
destitute of organic remains; but if such beds were formed and
still remain, they are probably unknown to us, for the oldest
formations that we know&mdash;those of the Eozoic age&mdash;contain traces
of such remains. It has, indeed, been suggested that these most
ancient organisms are, as it were, overlooked in the history of
creation, or regarded as equivalent to those shapeless monsters
and animals of the darkness that are referred to in the older
Turanian versions of this story of creation. I doubt very much,
however, if this is a fair interpretation of our ancient record;
but we shall be in a better position to discuss it when we come
to the actual introduction of animals.</p>

<p>Modern analogy would induce us to believe that the land was not
elevated suddenly; but either by a series of small paroxysms, as
in the case of Chili, or by a gradual and imperceptible movement,
as in the case of Sweden&mdash;two of the most remarkable modern
instances of elevation of land&mdash;accompanied, however, in the case
of the last by local subsidence.
<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
 In either of these ways the
seas and rivers would have time to smooth the more rugged
inequalities, to widen the ravines into valleys, and to spread
out sediment in the lower grounds; thus fitting the surface for
the habitation of plants and animals. We must not suppose,
however, that the dry land had any close resemblance to that now
existing in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
its form or distribution. Geology amply proves that
since the first appearance of dry land, its contour has
frequently been changed, and probably also its position. Hence
nearly all our present land consists of rocks which have been
formed under the waters, long after the period now under
consideration, and have been subsequently hardened and elevated;
and since all the existing high mountain ranges are of a
comparatively late age, it is probable that this primeval dry
land was low, as well as, in the earlier part of the period at
least, of comparatively small extent. It is, however, by no means
certain that there may not have been a greater expanse of land
toward the close of this period than that which afterwards
existed in those older periods of animal life to which the
earliest fossiliferous rocks of the geologist carry us back;
since, as already hinted, it seems to be a rule in creation that
each new object shall be highly developed of its kind at its
first appearance, and since there have been in geological time
many great subsidences as well as elevations. Neither must we
forget that the oldest land has been subjected throughout
geological time to wearing and degrading agencies, and that from
its waste the later formations have been mainly derived.</p>

<p>It would be wrong, however, to omit to state that, though we may
know at present no remains of the first dry land, we are not
ignorant of its general distribution; for the present continents
show, in the arrangement of their formations and mountain chains,
evidence that they are parts of a plan sketched out from the
beginning. It has often been remarked by physical geographers
that the great lines of coast and mountain ranges are generally
in directions approaching to northeast and southwest, or
northwest and southeast, and that where they run in other
directions, as in the case of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
south of Europe and Asia, they
are much broken by salient and re-entering angles, formed by
lines having these directions. Professor R. Owen, of Tennessee,
and Professor Pierce, of Harvard College, were, I believe, the
first to point out that these lines are in reality parts of great
circles tangent to the polar circles, and the latter to suggest a
theory of their origin, based on the action of solar heat and the
seasons on a cooling earth. This has been more fully stated by
Mr. W. Lowthian Green in his curious book, "Vestiges of the
Molten Globe."
<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
 It would appear that the great circles in
question are in reality at right angles to the line of direction
of the attraction of the sun and moon at the period of either
solstice, and when they happen to be in conjunction or opposition
at these periods; and that such circles would be the lines on
which the thin crust of a cooling globe would be most likely to
be ruptured by its internal tidal-wave. Whatever the cause of the
phenomenon, it is evident that in the formation of its surface
inequalities the earth has cracked&mdash;so to speak&mdash;along two series
of great circles tangent to the polar circles; and that these,
with certain subordinate lines of fracture running north and
south and east and west, have determined the forms of the
continents from their origin.</p>

<p>M. Elie de Beaumont, and after him most other geologists, have
attributed the elevation of the continents and the upheaval and
plication of mountain chains to the secular refrigeration of the
earth, causing its outer shell to become too capacious for its
contracting interior mass, and thus to break or bend, and to
settle toward the centre. This view would well accord with the
terms in which the elevation of the land is mentioned throughout
the Bible, and especially with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
general progress of the work
as we have gleaned it from the Mosaic narrative; since from the
period of the desolate void and aeriform deep to that now before
us secular refrigeration must have been steadily in progress. Let
us also observe here that the earliest fractures of the crust
would determine the first coast lines, and the first slopes along
which sedimentary matter would descend from the land and be
deposited in the sea. They would also modify the direction of the
ocean currents. Thus the deposition of new formations would be
directed by these old lines, as would also to some extent the
course of all subsequent fractures and plications. Thus it
happens that the lines of outcrop of the oldest rocks first
raised out of the waters already marked out the forms of the
continents, and that the later formations appear rather as
fillings-up and extensions of the skeleton established by the
first dry land. Farther, the lines of plication first established
along the borders of the continents formed resisting walls along
which, in the continued contraction of the earth, pressure was
exerted from the ocean bed, widening and elevating these lines of
upheaval, and still farther fixing the general forms of the
continents, and giving variety to their surfaces. In the progress
of geological time there have also been successive depressions
and re-elevations of the continental plateaus, subjecting them
alternately to the wearing and disintegrating action of the
atmosphere and its waters, and to the influence of waves and
ocean currents, and especially to that of the deep-seated polar
currents which have throughout geological ages been loading the
submerged areas of the earth's surface with the products of the
waste caused by frost and ice in the polar regions. These causes
again have been progressively increasing the oblateness of the
earth's figure, and, along with the slackening of its rotation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
preparing the way for those periodical collapses in the
equatorial and temperate regions which form the boundaries of
some of our most important geological periods.
<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
 Throughout all
these changes the great general plan of the continents, first
sketched out when the "foundations of the earth" were laid,
before Eozoic time, was being elaborated.</p>

<p>The same creative period that witnessed the first appearance of
dry land saw it also clothed with vegetation; and it is quite
likely that this is intended to teach that no time was lost in
clothing the earth with plants&mdash;that the first emerging portions
received their vegetable tenants as they became fitted for
them&mdash;and that each additional region, as it rose above the
surface of the waters, in like manner received the species of
plants for which it was adapted. What was the nature of this
earliest vegetation? The sacred writer specifies three
descriptions of plants as included in it; and, by considering the
terms which he uses, some information on this subject may be
gained.</p>

<p><i>Desh&eacute;</i>, translated "grass" in our version, is derived from a
verb signifying to spring up or bud forth; the same verb, indeed,
used in this verse to denote "bringing forth," literally causing
to spring up. Its radical meaning is, therefore, vegetation in
the act of sprouting or springing forth; or, as connected with
this, young and delicate herbage. Thus, in Job xxxviii., "To
satisfy the desolate and waste ground, and to cause the bud of
the <i>young herbage</i> to spring forth." Here the reference is, no
doubt, to the bulbous and tuberous rooted plants of the desert
plains, which, fading away in the summer drought, burst forth
with magical rapidity on the setting-in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of rain. The following
passages are similar: Psalm xxiii., "He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures" (literally, young or <i>tender herbage</i>);
Deuteronomy xxiii., "Small rain upon the <i>tender herb</i>;" Isaiah
xxxvii., "<i>Grass</i> on the house-tops." The word is also used for
herbage such as can be eaten by cattle or cut down for fodder,
though even in these cases the idea of young and tender herbage
is evidently included; "Fat as a heifer at <i>grass</i>" (Jer.
xiv.)&mdash;that is, feeding on young succulent grass, not that which
is dry and parched. "Cut down as the grass, or wither as the
green herb," like the soft, tender grass, soon cut down and
quickly withering. With respect to the use of the word in this
place, I may remark: 1. It is not here correctly translated by
the word "grass;" for grass bears seed, and is, consequently, a
member of the second class of plants mentioned. Even if we set
aside all idea of inspiration, it is obviously impossible that
any one living among a pastoral or agricultural people could have
been ignorant of this fact. 2. It can scarcely be a general term,
including all plants when in a young or tender state. The idea of
their springing up is included in the verb, and this was but a
very temporary condition. Besides, this word does not appear to
be employed for the young state of shrubs or trees. 3. We thus
appear to be shut up to the conclusion that <i>desh&eacute;</i> here means
those plants, mostly small and herbaceous, which bear no proper
seeds;
<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
 in other words, the Cryptogamia&mdash;as fungi, mosses,
lichens, ferns, etc. The remaining words are translated with
sufficient accuracy in our version. They denote seed-bearing or
phoenogamous herbs and trees. The special mention of the
fructification of plants is probably intended not only for
distinction, but also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
to indicate the new power of organic
reproduction now first introduced on the surface of our planet,
and to mark its difference from the creative act itself. That
this new and wondrous phenomenon should be so stated is thus in
strict scientific propriety, and it is precisely the point that
would be seized by an intelligent spectator of the visions of
creation, who had previously witnessed only the accretion and
disintegration of mineral substances, and to whom this marvellous
power of organic reproduction would be in every respect a new
creation.</p>

<p>The arrangement of plants in the three great classes of
cryptogams, seed-bearing herbs, and fruit-bearing trees differs
in one important point&mdash;viz., the separation of herbaceous plants
from trees&mdash;from modern botanical classification. It is, however,
sufficiently natural for the purposes of a general description
like this, and perhaps gives more precise ideas of the meaning
intended than any other arrangement equally concise and popular.
It is also probable that the object of the writer was not so much
a natural-history classification as an account of the <i>order</i> of
creation, and that he wishes to affirm that the introduction of
these three classes of plants on the earth corresponded with the
order here stated. This view renders it unnecessary to vindicate
the accuracy of the arrangement on botanical grounds, since the
historical order was evidently better suited to the purpose in
view, and in so far as the earlier appearance of cryptogamous
plants is concerned, it is in strict accordance with geological
fact.</p>

<p>A very important truth is contained in the expression "after its
kind"&mdash;that is, after its <i>species</i>; for the Hebrew "<i>min</i>," used
here, has strictly this sense, and, like the Greek <i>idea</i> and the
Latin <i>species</i>, conveys the notion of form as well as that of
kind. It is used to denote species of animals,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
in Leviticus i., 14, and in Deuteronomy xiv., 15. We are taught by this statement
that plants were created each kind by itself; and that creation
was not a sort of slump-work to be perfected by the operation of
a law of development, as fancied by some modern speculators. In
this assertion of the distinctness of species, and the production
of each as a distinct part of the creative plan, revelation
tallies perfectly with the conclusions of natural science, which
lead us to believe that each species, as observed by us, is
permanently reproductive, variable within narrow limits, and
incapable of permanent intermixture with other species; and
though hypotheses of modification by descent, and of the
production of new species by such modification, may be formed,
they are not in accordance with experience, and are still among
the unproved speculations which haunt the outskirts of true
science. We shall be better prepared, however, to weigh the
relations of such hypotheses to our revelation of origins when we
shall have reached the period of the introduction of animal life.</p>

<p>Some additional facts contained in the recapitulation of the
creative work in Chapter II. may very properly be considered
here, as they seem to refer to the climatal conditions of the
earth during the growth of the most ancient vegetation, and
before the final adjustment of the astronomical relations of the
earth on the fourth day. "And every shrub of the land before it
was on the earth, and every herb of the land before it sprung up.
For the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and
there was not a man to till the ground; but a mist ascended from
the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground." This has
been supposed to be a description of the state of the earth
during the whole period anterior to the fall of man. There is,
however, no Scripture evidence of this; and geology informs us
that rain fell as at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
present far back in the Pal&aelig;ozoic period,
countless ages before the creation of man or the existing
animals. Although, however, such a condition of the earth as that
stated in these verses has not been known in any geological
period, yet it is not inconceivable, but in reality corresponds
with the other conditions of nature likely to have prevailed on
the third day, as described in Genesis. The land of this period,
we may suppose, was not very extensive nor very elevated. Hence
the temperature would be uniform and the air moist. The luminous
and calorific matter connected with the sun still occupied a
large space, and therefore diffused heat and light more uniformly
than at present. The internal heat of the earth may still have
produced an effect in warming the oceanic waters. The combined
operation of these causes, of which we, perhaps, have some traces
as late as the Carboniferous period, might well produce a state
of things in which the earth was watered, not by showers of rain,
but by the gentle and continued precipitation of finely divided
moisture, in the manner now observed in those climates in which
vegetation is nourished for a considerable part of the year by
nocturnal mists and copious dews. The atmosphere, in short, as
yet partook in some slight degree of the same moist and misty
character which prevailed before the "establishment of the clouds
above"&mdash;the airy firmament of the second day. The introduction of
these explanatory particulars by the sacred historian furnishes
an additional argument for the theory of long periods. That
vegetation should exist for two or three natural days without
rain or the irrigation which is given in culture, was, as already
stated, a circumstance altogether unworthy of notice; but the
growth during a long period of a varied and highly organized
flora, without this advantage, and by the aid of a special
natural provision afterward discontinued,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
was in all respects so
remarkable and so highly illustrative of the expedients of the
divine wisdom that it deserved a prominent place.</p>

<p>It is evident that the words of the inspired writer include
plants belonging to all the great subdivisions of the vegetable
kingdom. This earliest vegetation was not rude or incomplete, or
restricted to the lower forms of life. It was not even, like that
of the coal period, solely or mainly cryptogamous or
gymnospermous. It included trees bearing fruit, as well as
lichens and mosses, and it received the same stamp of approbation
bestowed on other portions of the work&mdash;"it was good." We have a
good right to assume that its excellence had reference not only
to its own period, but to subsequent conditions of the earth.
Vegetation is the great assimilating power, the converter of
inorganic into organic matter suitable for the sustenance of
animals. In like manner the lower tribes of plants prepare the
way for the higher. We should therefore have expected <i>&agrave; priori</i>
that vegetation would have clothed the earth before the creation
of animals, and a sufficient time before it to allow soils to be
accumulated, and surplus stores of organic matter to be prepared
in advance: this consideration alone would also induce us to
assign a considerable duration to the third day. After the
elevation of land, and the draining off from it of the saline
matter with which it would be saturated, a process often very
tedious, especially in low tracts of ground, the soil would still
consist only of mineral matter, and must have been for a long
period occupied by plants suited to this condition of things, in
order that sufficient organic matter might be accumulated for the
growth of a more varied vegetation; a consideration which perhaps
illustrates the order of the plants in the narrative.</p>

<p>It may be objected to the above views that, however accordant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
with chemical and physiological probabilities, they do not
harmonize with the facts of geology; since the earliest
fossiliferous formations contain almost exclusively the remains
of animals, which must therefore have preceded, or at least been
coeval with, the earliest forms of terrestrial vegetation. This
objection is founded on well-ascertained facts, but facts which
may have no connection with the third day of creation when
regarded as a long period. The oldest geological formations are
of marine origin, and contain remains of marine animals, with
those of plants supposed to be allied to the existing alg&aelig; or
sea-weeds. Geology can not, however, assure us either that no
land plants existed contemporaneously with these earliest
animals, or that no land flora preceded them. These oldest
fossiliferous rocks may mark the commencement of animal life, but
they testify nothing as to the existence or non-existence of a
previous period of vegetation alone. Farther, the rocks which
contain the oldest remains of life exist as far as yet known in a
condition so highly metamorphic as almost to preclude the
possibility of their containing any distinguishable vegetable
fossils; yet they contain vast deposits of carbon in the form of
graphite, and if this, like more modern coaly matter, was
accumulated by vegetable growth, it must indicate an exuberance
of plants in these earliest geological periods, but of plants as
yet altogether unknown to us. It is possible, therefore, that in
these Eozoic rocks we may have remnants of the formations of the
third Mosaic day; and if we should ever be so fortunate as to
find any portion of them containing vegetable fossils, and these
of species differing from any hitherto known, either in a fossil
state or recent, and rising higher, in elevation and complexity
of type, than the flora of the succeeding Silurian and
Carboniferous eras, we may then suppose that we have penetrated
to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the monuments of this third creative &aelig;on. The only other
alternative by which these verses can be reconciled with geology
is that adopted by the late Hugh Miller, who supposes that the
plants of the third day are those of the Carboniferous period;
but, besides the apparent anachronism involved in this, we now
know that the coal flora consisted mainly of cryptogams allied to
ferns and club-mosses, and of gymnosperms allied to the pines and
cycads, the higher orders of plants being almost entirely
wanting. For these reasons we are shut up to the conclusion that
this flora of the third day must have its place before the
Pal&aelig;ozoic period of geology.</p>

<p>To those who are familiar with the vast lapse of time required by
the geological history of the earth, it may be startling to
ascribe the whole of it to three or four of the creative days.
If, however, it be admitted that these days were periods of
unknown duration, no reason remains for limiting their length any
farther than the facts of the case require. If in the strata of
the earth which are accessible to us we can detect the evidence
of its existence for myriads of years, why may not its Creator be
able to carry our view back for myriads more. It may be humbling
to our pride of knowledge, but it is not on any scientific ground
improbable, that the oldest animal remains known to geology
belong to the middle period of the earth's history, and were
preceded by an enormous lapse of ages in which the earth was
being prepared for animal existence, but of which no records
remain, except those contained in the inspired history.</p>

<p>It would be quite unphilosophical for geology to affirm either
that animal life must always have existed, or that its earliest
animals are necessarily the earliest organic beings. To use, with
a slight modification, the words of an able thinker
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
on these subjects,
<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
 "For ages the prejudice prevailed that the
historical period, or that which is coeval with the life of man,
exhausted the whole history of the globe. Geologists removed that
prejudice," but must not substitute "another in its place, viz.,
that geological time is coeval with the globe itself, or that
organic life always existed on its surface."</p>

<p>A second doubt as to the existence of this primitive flora may be
based on the statement that it included the highest forms of
plants. Had it consisted only of low and imperfect vegetables,
there might have been much less difficulty in admitting its
probability. Farther, we find that even in the Carboniferous
period scarcely any plants of the higher orders flourished, and
there was a preponderance of the lower forms of the vegetable
kingdom. We have, however, in geological chronology, many
illustrations of the fact that the progress of improvement has
not been continuous or uninterrupted, and that the preservation
of the flora and fauna of many geological periods has been very
imperfect. Hence the occurrence in one particular stratum or
group of strata of few or low representatives of animal and
vegetable life affords no proof that a better state of things may
not have existed previously. We also find, in the case of
animals, that each tribe attained to its highest development at
the time when, in the progress of creation, it occupied the
summit of the scale of life. Analogy would thus lead us to
believe that when plants alone existed, they may have assumed
nobler forms than any now existing, or that tribes now
represented by few and humble species may at that time have been
so great in numbers and development as to fill all the offices of
our present complicated flora, as well as, perhaps, some of those
now occupied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
by animals. We have this principle exemplified in
the Carboniferous flora, by the magnitude of its arborescent
club-mosses, and the vast variety of its gymnosperms. For this
reason we may anticipate that if any remains of this early
plant-creation should be disinterred, they will prove to be among
the most wonderful and interesting geological relics ever
discovered, and will enlarge our views of the compass and
capabilities of the vegetable kingdom, and especially of its
lower forms.</p>

<p>A farther objection is the uselessness of the existence of plants
for a long period, without any animals to subsist on or enjoy
them, and even without forming any accumulation of fossil fuel or
other products useful to man. The only direct answer to this has
already been given. The previous existence of plants may have
been, and probably was, essential to the comfort and subsistence
of the animals afterwards introduced. Independently of this,
however, we have an analogous case in the geological history of
animals, which prevents this fact from standing alone. Why was
the earth tenanted so long by the inferior races of animals, and
why were so much skill and contrivance expended on their
structures, and even on their external ornament, when there was
no intelligent mind on earth to appreciate their beauties. Even
in the present world we may as well ask why the uninhabited
islands of the ocean are found to be replete with luxuriant
vegetable life, why God causes it to rain in the desert where
human foot never treads, or why he clothes with a marvellous
exuberance of beautiful animal and plant forms the depths of the
sea. We can but say that these things seemed and seem good to the
Creator, and may serve uses unknown to us; and this is precisely
what we must be content to say respecting the plant-creation of
the Eozoic period.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Some writers
<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
 on this subject have suggested that the cosmical
use of this plant-creation was the abstraction from the
atmosphere of an excess of carbonic acid unfavorable to the
animal life subsequently to be introduced. This use it may have
served, and when its effects had been gradually lost through
metamorphism and decay, that second great withdrawal of carbon
which took place in the Carboniferous period may have been
rendered necessary. The reasons afforded by natural history for
supposing that plants preceded animals are thus stated by
Professor Dana:</p>

<p>"The proof from science of the existence of plants before animals
is inferential, and still may be deemed satisfactory. Distinct
fossils have not been found, all that ever existed in the
azoic
<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
 rocks having been obliterated. The arguments in the
affirmative are as follows:</p>

<p>"1. The existence of limestone rocks among the other beds,
similar limestones in later ages having been of organic origin;
also the occurrence of carbon in the shape of graphite, graphite
being, in known cases in rocks, a result of the alteration of the
carbon of plants.</p>

<p>"2. The fact that the cooling earth would have been fitted for
vegetable life for a long age before animals could have existed;
the principle being exemplified everywhere that the earth was
occupied at each period with the highest kinds of life the
conditions allowed.</p>

<p>"3. The fact that vegetation subserved an important purpose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
in the coal-period in ridding the atmosphere of carbonic acid for
the subsequent introduction of land animals, suggests a valid
reason for believing that the same great purpose, the true
purpose of vegetation, was effected through the ocean before the
<i>waters</i> were fitted for animal life.</p>

<p>"4. Vegetation being directly or mediately the food of animals,
it must have had a previous existence. The latter part of the
azoic age in geology we therefore regard as the age when the
plant kingdom was instituted, the latter half of the third day in
Genesis. However short or long the epoch, it was one of the great
steps of progress."</p>

<p>In concluding the examination of the work of the third day, I
must again remind the reader that, on the theory of long creative
periods, the words under consideration must refer to the first
introduction of vegetation, in forms that have long since ceased
to exist. Geology informs us that in the period of which it is
cognizant the vegetation of the earth has been several times
renewed, and that no plants of the older and middle geological
periods now exist. We may therefore rest assured that the
vegetable species, and probably also many of the generic and
family forms of the vegetation of the third day, have long since
perished, and been replaced by others suited to the changed
condition of the earth. It is indeed probable that during the
third and fourth days themselves there might be many removals and
renewals of the terrestrial flora, so that perhaps every species
created at the commencement of the introduction of plants may
have been extinct before the close of the period. Nevertheless it
was marked by the introduction of vegetation, which in one or
another set of forms has ever since clothed the earth.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the third day the earth was still covered
by the waters. As time advanced islands and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
mountain-peaks arose
from the ocean, vomiting forth the molten and igneous materials
of the interior of the earth's crust. Plains and valleys were
then spread around, rivers traced out their beds, and the ocean
was limited by coasts and divided by far-stretching continents.
At the command of the Creator plants sprung from the soil&mdash;the
earliest of organized structures&mdash;at first probably few and
small, and fitted to contend against the disadvantages of soils
impregnated with saline particles and destitute of organic
matter; but as the day advanced increasing in number, magnitude,
and elevation, until at length the earth was clothed with a
luxuriant and varied vegetation, worthy the approval of the
Creator, and the admiring song of the angelic "sons of God."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">LUMINARIES.</span><br /></h2>

<p style="font-size:70%;text-align:left;text-indent:2em;font-weight:bold;">"And God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse
of heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons,
and for days and for years. And let them be for luminaries in the expanse of heaven,
to give light on the earth: and it was so.</p>

<p style="font-size:70%;text-align:left;text-indent:2em;font-weight:bold;">
"And God made two great luminaries, the greater luminary to
preside over the day, the lesser luminary to preside over
the night. He made the stars also. And God placed them in
the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth, and to
preside over the day and over the night, and to separate the
light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And
the evening and the morning were the fourth day."&mdash;Genesis
i., 14-19.</p>


<p>After so long a sojourn on the earth, we are in these verses
again carried to the heavens. Every scientific reader is struck
with the position of this remarkable statement, interrupting as
it does the progress of the organic creation, and constituting a
break in the midst of the terrestrial history which is the
immediate subject of the narrative; thus, in effect, as has often
been remarked, dividing the creative week into two portions. Why
was the completion of the heavenly bodies so long delayed? Why
were light and vegetation introduced previously? If we can not
fully answer these questions, we may at least suppose that the
position of these verses is not accidental, though certainly not
that which would have been chosen for its own sake by any
fabricator of systems ancient or modern. Let us inquire, however,
what are the precise terms of the record.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
1. The word here used to denote the objects produced clearly
distinguishes them from the product of the first day's creation.
Then God said, "Let <i>light</i> be;" he now says, "Let <i>luminaries</i>
or light-bearers be." We have already seen that the light of the
first day may have emanated from an extended luminous mass, at
first occupying the whole extent of the solar system, and more or
less attached to the several planetary bodies, and afterwards
concentrated within the earth's orbit. The verses now under
consideration inform us that the process of concentration was now
complete, that our great central luminary had attained to its
perfect state. This process of concentration may have been
proceeding during the whole of the intervening time, or it may
have been completed at once by some more rapid process of the
nature of a direct interposition of creative power.</p>

<p>2. The division of light from darkness is expressed by the same
terms, and is of the same nature with that on the first day. This
separation was now produced in its full extent by the perfect
condensation of the luminiferous matters around the sun.</p>

<p>3. The heavenly bodies are said to be intended for <i>signs</i>&mdash;that
is, for marks or indications&mdash;either of the seasons, days, and
years afterwards mentioned, or of the majesty and power of the
true God, as the Creator of objects so grand and elevated as to
become to the ignorant heathen objects of idolatrous worship; or
perhaps of the earthly events they are supposed to influence. The
arrangements now perfected for the first time enabled natural
days, seasons, and years to have their limits accurately marked.
Previously to this period there had been no distinctly marked
seasons, and consequently no natural separation of years, nor
were the limits of days at all accurately defined.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
4. The terms <i>expanse</i> and <i>heaven</i>, previously applied to the
atmosphere, are here combined to denote the more distant starry
and planetary heavens. There is no ambiguity involved in this,
since the writer must have well known that no one could so far
mistake as to suppose that the heavenly bodies are placed in that
atmospheric expanse which supports the clouds.</p>

<p>5. The luminaries were <i>made</i> or appointed to their office on the
fourth day. They are not said to have been created, being
included in the creation of the beginning. They were now
completed, and fully fitted for their work. An important part of
this fitting seems to have been the setting or placing them in
the heavens, conveying to us the impression that the mutual
relations and regular motions of the heavenly bodies were now for
the first time perfected.</p>

<p>6. The stars are introduced in a parenthetical manner, which
leaves it doubtful whether we are merely informed in general
terms that they are works of God, as well as those heavenly
bodies which are of more importance to us, or that they were
arranged as heavenly luminaries useful to our earth on the fourth
day. The term includes the fixed stars, and it is by no means
probable that these were in any way affected by the work referred
to the fourth day, any farther than their appearance from our
earth is concerned. This view is confirmed by the language of the
104th Psalm, which in this part of the work mentions the sun and
moon alone, without the fixed stars or planets.</p>

<p>It is evident that the changes referred to this period related to
the whole solar system, and resulted in the completion of that
system in the form which it now bears, or at least in the final
adjustment of the motions and relations of the earth; and we have
reason to believe that the condensation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of the luminous envelope
around the sun was one of the most important of these changes. On
the hypothesis of La Place, already referred to as most in
accordance with the earlier stages of the work, there seems to be
no especial reason why the completion of the process of
elaboration of the sun and planets should be accelerated at this
particular stage. We can easily understand, however, that those
closing steps which brought the solar system into a state of
permanent and final equilibrium would form a marked epoch in the
work; and we can also understand that now, on the eve of the
introduction of animal life, there is a certain propriety in the
representation of the Creator interfering to close up the merely
inorganic part of his great work, and bring this department at
least to its final perfection. The fourth day, then, in
geological language, marks <i>the complete introduction of
"existing causes" in inorganic nature</i>, and we henceforth find no
more creative interference, except in the domain of organization.
This accords admirably with the deductions of modern geology, and
especially with that great principle so well expounded by Sir
Charles Lyell, and which forms the true basis of modern
geological reasonings&mdash;that we should seek in existing causes of
change for the explanation of the appearances of the rocks of the
earth's crust. Geology probably carries us back to the
introduction of animal life; and shows us that since that time
land, sea, and atmosphere, summer and winter, day and night&mdash;all
the great inorganic conditions affecting animal life&mdash;have
existed as at present, and have been subject to modifications the
same in kind with those which they now experience, though perhaps
different in degree. In this ancient record we find in like
manner that the period immediately preceding the creation of
animals witnessed the completion of all the great general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
arrangements on which these phenomena depend. The Bible,
therefore, and science agree in the truth that existing causes
have been in full force since the creation of animals; and that
since that period the exercise of creative power has been limited
to the organic world. This has a curious bearing, not often
thought of, on modern theories of evolution as compared with the
teaching of the Bible. In one important sense, absolute creation,
in so far as the inorganic universe is concerned, is in our
Mosaic narrative limited to the production of matter and force at
first. All else is called making, forming, or appointing. Thus
the production of all the arrangements of the waters, the
atmosphere, the earth, and the heavens, in the work of the first
four days, and even the introduction of plants, may be correctly
termed an evolution or development from preformed materials, with
the single exception that the reproductive power and specific
diversities of plants are recognized as entirely new facts.
Creation is properly resumed when animal life is introduced.
Hence, in so far as a comparison with the terms of Genesis is
concerned, hypotheses as to the evolution of animal life from
inorganic matter are in a different position from hypotheses as
to the previous evolution of the parts of inorganic nature; and
still more so from statements as to the progress of inorganic
nature subsequent to the introduction of animals; since within
that period, which really includes the whole of geological time,
absolutely no creation whatever in the domain of inanimate nature
is affirmed in the Biblical record to have taken place. On the
contrary, all the arrangements of inorganic nature are
represented as finally completed before the creation of animals.</p>

<p>The obliquity of the earth's axis, which gives us the changes of
the seasons, is apparently included in the arrangements
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of the fourth creative day. The cause of this obliquity, and the time
when it may have attained to its present amount, have been
fertile themes of discussion. It is clear, however, that if this
obliquity was established, as appears to be stated here, before
the introduction of animal life, it can have no bearing on the
changes of climate of which we have evidence in geological time
since the dawn of animal life, unless, indeed, it is capable of
greater variation than astronomers admit; and the same remark
applies to supposed changes in the position of the poles
themselves. There is, however, nothing in this record to oppose
the idea of any secular changes in these arrangements under the
laws appointed in the fourth creative period.</p>

<p>The record relating to the fourth day is silent respecting the
mundane history of the period; and geology gives no very certain
information concerning it. If, however, we assume that any of the
Eozoic or pre-eozoic rocks are deposits of this or the preceding
period, we may infer from the disturbances and alteration which
these have suffered, prior to the deposition of the Cambrian and
Silurian, that during or toward the close of this day the crust
of the earth was affected by great movements. There is another
consideration also leading to important conclusions in relation
to this period. In the earliest fossiliferous rocks there seems
to be good evidence that the dry land contemporary with the seas
in which they were formed was of very small extent. Now, since on
the third day a very plentiful and highly developed vegetation
was produced, we may infer that during that period the extent of
dry land was considerable, and was probably gradually increasing.
If, then, the Cambrian and Silurian systems, so rich in marine
organic remains, belong to the commencement of the fifth day, we
must conclude that during
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the fourth much of the land previously
existing had been again submerged. In other words, during the
third day the extent of terrestrial surface was increasing, on
the fourth day it diminished, and on the fifth it again
increased, and probably has on the whole continued to increase up
to the present time. One most important geological consequence of
this is that the marine animals of the fifth day probably
commenced their existence on sea bottoms which were the old soil
surfaces of submerged continents previously clothed with
vegetation, and which consequently contained much organic matter
fitted to form a basis of support for the newly created animals.
</p>

<p>I shall close my remarks on the fourth day by a few quotations
from those passages of Scripture which refer to the objects of
this day's work. I have already referred to that beautiful
passage in Deuteronomy where the Israelites are warned against
the crime of worshipping those heavenly bodies which the Lord God
hath "divided to every nation under the whole heaven." In the
book of Job also we find that the heavenly bodies were in his day
regarded as signal manifestations of the power of God, and that
several of the principal constellations had received names:</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:5em;">"He commandeth the sun, and it shineth not;<br />
He sealeth up the stars;
<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a><br />
He alone spreadeth out the heavens,<br />
And walketh on the high waves of the sea;
<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
He maketh Arcturus, Orion,<br />
The Pleiades, and the hidden chambers of the south;<br />
Who doeth great things past finding out;<br />
Yea, marvellous things beyond number."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&mdash;Job ix., 9.</span></p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:5em;">
"Canst thou tighten the bonds of the Pleiades,
<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a><br />
Or loose the bands of Orion?<br />
Canst thou bring forth the Mazzaroth in their season,<br />
Or lead forth Arcturus and its sons?<br />
Knowest thou the laws of the heavens,<br />
Or hast thou appointed their dominion over the earth?"<br />

<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&mdash;Job xxxviii., 31.</span></p>

<p>I may merely remark on these passages that the chambers of the
south are supposed to be those parts of the southern heavens
invisible in the latitude in which Job resided. The bonds of
Pleiades and of Orion probably refer to the apparently close
union of the stars of the former group, and the wide separation
of those of the latter; a difference which, to the thoughtful
observer of the heavens, is more striking than most instances of
that irregular grouping of the stars which still forms a question
in astronomy, from the uncertainty whether it is real, or only an
optical deception arising from stars at different distances
coming nearly into a line with each other. I have seen in some
recent astronomical work this very instance of the Pleiades and
Orion taken as a marked illustration of this problematical fact
in astronomy. <i>Mazzaroth</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
are supposed by modern expositors to be the signs of the Zodiac.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Hebrew books give us little information as to
the astronomical theories of the time when they were written.
They are entirely non-committal as to the nature of the
connections and revolutions of the heavenly bodies; and indeed
regard these as matters in their time beyond the grasp of the
human mind, though well known to the Creator and regulated by his
laws. From other sources we have facts leading to the belief that
even in the time of Moses, and certainly in that of the later
Biblical writers, there was not a little practical astronomy in
the East, and some good theory. The Hindoo astronomy professes to
have observations from 3000 B.C., and the arguments of Baily and
others, founded on internal evidence, give some color of truth to
the claim. The Chaldeans at a very early period had ascertained
the principal circles of the sphere, the position of the poles,
and the nature of the apparent motions of the heavens as the
results of revolution on an inclined axis. The Egyptian astronomy
we know mainly from what the Greeks borrowed from it. Thales, 640
B.C., taught that the moon is lighted by the sun, and that the
earth is spherical, and the position of its five zones.
Pythagoras, 580 B.C., knew, in addition to the sphericity of the
earth, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the identity of the evening
and morning star, and that the earth revolves round the sun. This
Greek astronomy appears immediately after the opening of Egypt to
the Greeks; and both these philosophers studied in that country.
Such knowledge, and more of the same character, may therefore
have existed in Egypt at a much earlier period.</p>

<p>The Psalms abound in beautiful references to the creation of the
fourth day</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:5em;">
:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
"When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers,<br />
The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;<br />
What is man, that thou art mindful of him?<br />
Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&mdash;Psalm viii.</span></p>


<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:10em;">
"Who telleth the number of the stars,<br />
Who calleth them all by their names.<br />
Great is our Lord, and of great praise;<br />
His understanding is infinite.<br />
The Lord lifteth up the meek;<br />
He casteth the wicked to the ground."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;Psalm cxlvii.</span></p>


<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:3em;">
"The heavens declare the glory of God,<br />
The firmament showeth his handiwork;<br />
Day unto day uttereth speech,<br />
Night unto night showeth knowledge.<br />
They have no speech nor language,<br />
Their voice is not heard;<br />
Yet their line is gone out to all the earth,<br />
And their words to the end of the world.<br />
In them hath he set a pavilion for the sun,<br />
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,<br />
And rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.<br />
Its going forth is from the end of the heavens,<br />
And its circuit unto the end of them.<br />
And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&mdash;Psalm xix.</span></p>

<p>These are excellent illustrations of the truth of the Scripture
mode of treating natural objects, in connection with their Maker.
It is but a barren and fruitless philosophy which sees the work
and not its author&mdash;a narrow piety which loves God but despises
his works. The Bible holds forth the golden mean between these
extremes, in a strain of lofty poetry and acute perception of the
great and beautiful, whether seen in the Creator or reflected
from his works.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
The work of this day opens up a wide field for astronomical
illustration, more especially in relation to the wisdom and
benevolence of the Creator as displayed in the heavens; but it
would be foreign to our present purpose to enter into these.</p>

<p>It may be well, however, to think for a moment of the importance
of the facts suggested by the writer of Genesis in mentioning the
use of the heavenly bodies as signs of time. To what extent
civilization or even the continued existence of man as an
intelligent being would have been possible without the marks of
subdivision of time given by the great astronomical clock of the
universe, it is almost impossible for us to imagine. Without such
marks of time, in any case, the whole fabric of human culture
must have been different from what it is. Farther, in connection
with this, it is a grand thought of our early revelation that all
these heavenly bodies, however magnificent, and however they
might seem to the heathen to be objects of worship, are but marks
on God's clock, parts of a mere machine which keeps time for us,
and is therefore our servant, as the children of the great
Artificer, and not our ruler. The idea has been termed an
astrological one; but astrology as a means of divination has no
place in the record. The heavenly bodies are under the law of the
Creator, and their function relatively to us is to give light and
to give time. Astrological divination is an outgrowth of the
Sab&aelig;an idolatry, and held in abomination by the monotheistic
author of Genesis. His object may be summed up in the following
general statements:</p>

<p>1. The heavenly hosts and their arrangements are the work of
Jehovah, and are regulated wholly by his laws or ordinances; a
striking illustration of the recognition by the Hebrew writer
both of creative interference, and that stable,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
natural law which too often withdraws the mind of the philosopher from the
ideas of creation and of providence.</p>

<p>2. The heavenly bodies have a relation to the earth&mdash;are parts of
the same plan, and, whatever other uses they were made to serve,
were made for the benefit of man.</p>

<p>3. The general physical arrangements of the solar system were
perfected before the introduction of animals on our planet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">THE LOWER ANIMALS.</span><br /></h2>

<p style="font-size:80%;text-indent:3em;text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
"And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarming living
creatures, and let birds fly on the surface of the expanse
of heaven. And God created great reptiles, and every living
moving thing, which the waters brought forth abundantly,
after their kind, and every bird after its kind; and God saw
that it was good.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;text-indent:3em;text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and
fill the waters of the seas, and let the flying creatures
multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were
the fifth day."&mdash;Genesis i., 20-23.</p>


<p>In these words, so full of busy, active, thronging life, we now
enter on that part of the earth's history which has been most
fully elucidated by geology, and we have thus an additional
reason for carefully weighing the terms of the narrative, which
here, as in other places, contain large and important truths
couched in language of the simplest character.</p>

<p>1. In accordance with the views now entertained by the best
lexicographers, the word translated in our version "creeping
things" has been rendered "prolific or swarming creatures." The
Hebrew is <i>Sheretz</i>, a noun derived from the verb used in this
verse to denote bringing forth abundantly. It is loosely
translated in the Septuagint <i>Erpeta</i>, reptiles; and this view
our English translators appear to have adopted, without, perhaps,
any very clear notions of the creatures intended. The manner in
which it is used in other passages places its true meaning beyond
doubt. I select as illustrations of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
most apposite character those verses in Leviticus in which clean and unclean animals are
specified, and in which we have a right to expect the most
precise zoological nomenclature that the Hebrew can afford. In
Leviticus xi., 20-23, <i>insects</i> are defined to be <i>flying
sheretzim</i>, and in verse 29, etc., under the designation
"<i>sheretzim of the land</i>," we have animals named in our version
the weasel, mouse, tortoise, ferret, chameleon, lizard, snail,
and mole. The first of these animals is believed to have been a
burrowing creature, perhaps a mole; the second, from the meaning
of its name, "ravager of fields," is thought to have been a
mouse. Some doubt, however, attends both of these
identifications, but it appears certain that the remaining six
species are small reptiles, principally lizards. We learn,
therefore, that the smaller reptiles, and <i>perhaps</i> also a few
small mammals, are <i>sheretzim</i>. In verses 41 and 42 we are
introduced to other tribes. "And every <i>sheretz</i> that swarmeth on
the earth shall be an abomination unto you; it shall not be
eaten; whatsoever goeth upon the belly (serpents, worms, snails,
etc.), and whatsoever hath more feet (than four) (insects,
arachnidans, myriapods)." In verses 9 and 10 of the same chapter
we have an enumeration of the <i>sheretzim</i> of the waters:
"Whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas and
in the rivers, them shall ye eat. And all that have not fins and
scales in the seas and the rivers, of all that swarm in the
waters (all the <i>sheretzim</i> of the waters), they shall be an
abomination unto you." Here the general term <i>sheretz</i> includes
all the fishes and the invertebrate animals of the waters. From
the whole of the above passages we learn that this is a general
term for all the invertebrate animals and the two lower classes
of vertebrates, or, in other words, for the whole animal kingdom
except the mammalia and birds. To all these creatures the name
is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
particularly appropriate, all of them being oviparous or
ovoviviparous, and consequently producing great numbers of young
and multiplying very rapidly. The only other creatures which can
be included under the term are the two doubtful species of small
mammals already mentioned. Nothing can be more fair and obvious
than this explanation of the term, based both on etymology and on
the precise nomenclature of the ceremonial law. We conclude,
therefore, that the prolific animals of the fifth day's creation
belonged to the three Cuvierian sub-kingdoms of the Radiata,
Articulata, and Mollusca, and to the classes of Fish and Reptiles
among the vertebrata.</p>

<p>2. One peculiar group of <i>sheretzim</i> is especially distinguished
by name&mdash;the <i>tanninim</i>, or "great whales" of our version. It
would be amusing, had we time, to notice the variety of
conjectures to which this word has given rise, and the
perplexities of commentators in reference to it. In our version
and the Septuagint it is usually rendered dragon; but in this
place the seventy have thought proper to put <i>Ketos</i> (whale), and
our translators have followed them. Subsequent translators and
commentators have laid under contribution all sorts of marine
monsters, including the sea-serpent, in their endeavors to attach
a precise meaning to the word; while others have been content to
admit that it may signify any kind or all kinds of large aquatic
animals. The greater part of the difficulty appears to have
arisen from confounding two distinct words, <i>tannin</i> and <i>tan</i>,
both names of animals; and the confusion has been increased by
the circumstance that in two places the words have been
interchanged, probably by errors of transcribers. <i>Tan</i> occurs in
twelve places, and from these we can gather that it inhabits
ruined cities, deserts, and places to which ostriches resort,
that it suckles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
its young, is of predaceous and shy habits,
utters a wailing cry, and is not of large size, nor formidable to
man. The most probable conjecture as to the animal intended is
that of Gesenius, who supposes it to be the jackal. The other
word (<i>tannin</i>), which is that used in the text, is applied as an
emblem of Egypt and its kings, and also of the conquering kings
of Babylon. It is spoken of as furious when enraged, and
formidable to man, and is said to be an inhabitant of rivers and
of the sea, but more especially of the Nile. In short, it is the
crocodile of the Nile. We can easily understand the perplexity of
those writers who suppose these two words to be identical, and
endeavor to combine all the characters above mentioned in one
animal or tribe of animals. As a farther illustration of the
marked difference in the meanings of the two words, we may
compare the 34th and 37th verses of the fifty-first chapter of
Jeremiah. In the first of these verses the King of Babylon is
represented as a "dragon" (<i>tannin</i>), which had swallowed up
Israel. In the second it is predicted that Babylon itself shall
become heaps, a dwelling-place for "dragons" (<i>tanim</i>). There can
be no doubt that the animals intended here are quite different.
The devouring <i>tannin</i> is a huge predaceous river reptile, a fit
emblem of the Babylonian monarch; the <i>tan</i> is the jackal that
will soon howl in his ruined palaces. It is interesting to know
that philologists trace a connection between <i>tannin</i> and the
Greek <i>teino</i>, Latin <i>tendo</i>, and similar words, signifying to
stretch or extend, in the Sanscrit, Gothic, and other languages,
leading to the inference that the Hebrew word primarily denotes a
lengthened or extended creature, which corresponds well with its
application to the crocodile. Taking all the above facts in
connection, we are quite safe in concluding that the creatures
referred to by the word under consideration are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
literally large reptilian animals; and, from the special mention made of them, we
may infer that, in their day, they were the lords of
creation.
<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>3. In verse 21 the remainder of the <i>sheretzim</i>, besides the
larger reptiles, are included in the general expression, "Living
creature that moveth." The term "living creature" is, literally,
"creature having the breath of life;" the power of respiration
being apparently in Hebrew the distinctive character of the
animal. The word moveth (<i>ramash</i>), in its more general sense,
expresses the power of voluntary motion, as exhibited in animals
in general. In a few places, however, it has a more precise
meaning, as in 1 Kings iv., 33, where the vertebrated animals are
included in the four classes of "beasts, fowl, <i>creeping things</i>
(or reptiles, <i>remes</i>), and fishes." In the present connection it
probably has its most general sense; unless, indeed, the apparent
repetition in this verse relates to the amphibious or
semi-terrestrial creatures associated with the great reptiles;
and, in that case, the humbler reptilian animals alone may be
meant.</p>

<p>4. We may again note that the introduction of animal life is
marked by the use of the word "create," for the first time since
the general creation of the heavens and the earth. We may also
note that the animal, as well as the plant, was created "after
its kind," or "species by species." The animals are grouped under
three great classes&mdash;the Remes, the Tanninim, and the Birds; but,
lest any misconception should arise as to the relations of
species to these groups, we are expressly informed that the
species is here the true unit of the creative work. It is worth
while, therefore, to note that this most ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
authority on this much controverted topic connects species on the one hand
with the creative fiat, and on the other with the power of
continuous reproduction.</p>

<p>5. In addition to the great mass of <i>sheretzim</i>, so accurately
characterized by Milton as</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">"&mdash;&mdash;Reptile with spawn abundant,"</p>

<p>the creation of the fifth day included a higher tribe of
oviparous animals&mdash;the birds, the fowl or winged creature of the
text. Birds alone, we think, must be meant here, as we have
already seen that insects are included under the general term
<i>sheretzim</i>.</p>

<p>6. It is farther to be observed that <i>the waters</i> give origin to
the first animals&mdash;an interesting point when we consider the
contrast here with the creation of plants and of the higher
animals, both of which proceed from the earth.</p>

<p>7. It can not fail to be observed that we have in these verses
two different arrangements of the animals created, neither
corresponding exactly with what modern science teaches us to
regard as the true grouping of the animal kingdom, according to
its affinities. The order in the first enumeration should, from
the analogy of the chapter, indicate that of successive creation.
The order of the second list may, perhaps, be that of the
relative importance of the animals, as it appeared to the writer.
Or there may have been a twofold division of the period&mdash;the
earlier commencing with the creation of the humbler
invertebrates, the later characterized by the great
reptiles&mdash;which is the actual state of the case as disclosed by
geology.</p>

<p>8. The Creator recognizes the introduction of sentient existence
and volition by <i>blessing</i> this new work of his hands, and
inviting the swarms of the newly peopled world to enjoy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
that happiness for which they were fitted, and to increase and fill
the earth, inaugurating thus a new power destined to still higher
developments.</p>

<p>When we inquire what information geology affords respecting the
period under consideration, the answer may be full and explicit.
Geological discovery has carried us back to an epoch
corresponding with the beginning of this day, and has disclosed a
long and varied series of living beings, extending from this
early period up to the introduction of the higher races of
animals. To enter on the geological details of these changes, and
on descriptions of the creatures which succeeded each other on
the earth, would swell this volume into a treatise on
pal&aelig;ontology, and would be quite unnecessary, as so many
excellent popular works on this subject already exist. I shall,
therefore, confine myself to a few general statements, and to
marking the points in which Scripture and geology coincide in
their respective histories of this long period, which appears to
include the whole of the Pal&aelig;ozoic and Mesozoic epochs of
geology, with their grand and varied succession of rock
formations and living beings.</p>

<p>In the Primordial or oldest fossiliferous rocks next in
succession to those great Eozoic formations in which protozoa
alone have been discovered, we find the remains of crustaceans,
mollusks, and radiates&mdash;such as shrimps, shell-fish, and
starfishes&mdash;which appear to have inhabited the bottom of a
shallow ocean. Among these were some genera belonging to the
higher forms of invertebrate life, but apparently as yet no
vertebrated animals. Fishes were then introduced, and have left
their remains in the upper Silurian rocks, and very abundantly in
the Devonian and Carboniferous, in the latter of which also the
first reptiles occur, but are principally members of that lower
group to which the frogs and newts and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
their allies belong. The animal kingdom appears to have reached no higher than the
reptiles in the Pal&aelig;ozoic or primary period of geology, and its
reptiles are comparatively small and few; though fishes had
attained to a point of perfection which they have not since
exceeded. There was also, especially in the Carboniferous age, an
abundant and luxuriant vegetation. The Mesozoic period is,
however, emphatically the age of reptiles. This class then
reached its climax, in the number, perfection, and magnitude of
its species, which filled all those stations in the economy of
nature now assigned to the mammalia. Birds also belong to this
era, though apparently much less numerous and important than at
present. Only a few species of small mammals, of the lowest or
marsupial type, appear as a presage of the mammalian creation of
the succeeding tertiary era. In these two geological periods,
then&mdash;the Pal&aelig;ozoic and Mesozoic&mdash;we find, first, the lower
<i>sheretzim</i> represented by the invertebrata and the fishes, then
the great reptiles and the birds; and it can not be denied that,
if we admit that the Mosaic day under consideration corresponds
with these geological periods, it would be impossible better to
characterize their creations in so few words adapted to popular
comprehension. I may add that all the species whose remains are
found in the Pal&aelig;ozoic and Mesozoic rocks are extinct, and known
to us only as fossils; and their connection with the present
system of nature consists only in their forming with it a more
perfect series than our present fauna alone could afford, unless,
indeed, we should find reason to believe that any modern animals
are their modified descendants. They belong to the same system of
types, but are parts of it which have served their purpose and
have been laid aside. The coincidences above noted between
geology and Scripture may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
1. According to both records, the causes which at present
regulate the distribution of light, heat, and moisture, and of
land and water, were, during the whole of this period, much the
same as at present. The eyes of the trilobite of the old Silurian
rocks are fitted for the same conditions with respect to light
with those of existing animals of the same class. The coniferous
trees of the coal measures show annual rings of growth.
Impressions of rain-marks have been found in the shales of the
coal measures and Devonian system. Hills and valleys, swamps and
lagoons, rivers, bays, seas, coral reefs and shell beds, have all
left indubitable evidence of their existence in the geological
record. On the other hand, the Bible affirms that all the earth's
physical features were perfected on the fourth day, and
immediately before the creation of animals. The land and the
water have undergone during this long lapse of ages many minor
changes. Whole tribes of animals and plants have been swept away
and replaced by others, but the general aspect of inorganic
nature has remained the same.</p>

<p>2. Both records show the existence of vegetation during this
period; though the geologic record, if taken alone, would, from
its want of information respecting the third day, lead us to
infer that plants are no older than animals, while the Bible does
not speak of the nature of the vegetation that may have existed
on the fifth day.</p>

<p>3. Both records inform us that reptiles and birds were the higher
and leading forms of animals, and that all the lower forms of
animals co-existed with them. In both we have especial notice of
the gigantic Saurian reptiles of the latter part of the period;
and if we have the remains of a few small species of mammals in
the Mesozoic rocks, these, like a few similar creatures
apparently included under the word <i>sheretz</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
in Leviticus, are not sufficiently important to negative the general fact of the
reign of reptiles.
<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>4. It accords with both records that the work of creation in this
period was gradually progressive. Species after species was
locally introduced, extended itself, and, after having served its
purpose, gradually became extinct. And thus each successive rock
formation presents new groups of species, each rising in numbers
and perfection above the last, and marking a gradual assimilation
of the general conditions of our planet to their present state,
yet without any convulsions or general catastrophes affecting the
whole earth at once.</p>

<p>5. In both records the time between the creation of the first
animals and the introduction of the mammalia as a dominant class
forms a well-marked period. I would not too positively assert
that the close of the fifth day accords precisely with that of
the Mesozoic or secondary period. The well-marked line of
separation, however, in many parts of the world, between this and
the earlier tertiary rocks succeeding to it, points to this as
extremely probable.</p>

<p>It thus appears that Scripture and geology so far concur
respecting the events of this period as to establish, even
without any other evidence, a probability that the fifth day
corresponds with the geological ages with which I have endeavored
to identify it. Geology, however, gives us no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
means of measuring precisely the length of this day; but it gives us the impression
that it occupied an enormous length of time, compared with which
the whole human period is quite insignificant; and rivalling
those mythical "days of the Creator" which we have noticed as
forming a part of the Hindoo mythology.</p>

<p>Why was the earth thus occupied for countless ages by an animal
population whose highest members were reptiles and birds? The
fact can not be doubted, since geology and Scripture, the
research of man and the Word of God, concur in affirming it. We
know that the lowest of these creatures was, in its own place, no
less worthy of the Creator than those which we regard as the
highest in the scale of organization, and that the animals of the
ancient, equally with those of the modern world, abounded in
proofs of the wisdom, power, and goodness of their Maker.
Comparative anatomy has shown that these extinct animals, though
often varying much from their modern representatives, are in no
respect rude or imperfect; that they have the same appearance of
careful planning and elaborate execution, the same combination of
ornament and utility, the same nice adaptation to the conditions
of their existence, which we observe in modern creatures. In
addition to this, the many new and wonderful contrivances and
combinations which they present, and their relations to existing
objects, have greatly enlarged our views of the variety and
harmony of the whole system of nature. They are, therefore, in
these respects, not without their use as manifestations of the
Creator, in this our later age.</p>

<p>There is another reason, hinted at by Buckland, Miller, and other
writers on this subject, which weighs much with my mind. All
animals and plants are constructed on a few leading types or
patterns, which are again divided into subordinate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
types, just as in architecture we have certain leading styles, and these
again may admit of several orders, and these of farther
modifications. Types are farther modified to suit a great variety
of minor adaptations. Now we know that the earth is, at any one
time, inadequate to display all the modifications of all the
types. Hence our existing system of organic nature, though
probably more complete than any that preceded it, is still only
fragmentary. It is like what architecture would be, if all
memorials of all buildings more than a century old were swept
away. But, from the beginning to the end of the creative work,
there has been, or will be, room for the whole plan. Hence
fossils are little by little completing our system of nature;
and, if all were known, would perhaps wholly do so. The great
plan must be progressive, and all its parts must be perishable,
except its last culminating-point and archetype, man. Tennyson
expresses this truth in the following lines:</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left: 30%;">"The wish that of the living whole<br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;">No life may fail beyond the grave;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;">Derives it not from what we have</span><br />
The likest God within the soul?<br /><br />

Are God and Nature then at strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That Nature lends such evil dreams?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So careful of the type she seems,</span><br />
So careless of the single life.<br /><br />

'So careful of the type?' but no.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From scarped cliff and quarried stone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She cries, 'a thousand types are gone;</span><br />
I care for nothing, all shall go.<br /><br />

'Thou makest thine appeal to me:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I bring to life, I bring to death:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The spirit does but mean the breath:</span><br />
I know no more.' And he, shall he,<br /><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Man, her last work, who seem'd so fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such splendid purpose in his eyes,</span><br />

Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer,<br /><br />

Who trusted God was love indeed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And love Creation's final law&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw,</span><br />

Who loved, who suffer'd countless ills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who battled for the True, the Just,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Be blown about the desert dust,</span><br />
Or seal'd within the iron hills?<br /><br />

No more? A monster, then, a dream,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O for thy voice to soothe and bless!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What hope of answer, or redress?</span><br />
Behind the veil, behind the veil."</p>

<p>The farther explanation given by evolutionists that those ancient
forms of life may be the actual ancestors of the present animals,
and that through all the ages the Creator was gradually
perfecting his work by a series of descents with modification,
was probably not before the mind of our ancient Hebrew authority,
nor need we attach much value to it till some proof of the
process has been obtained from Nature. A farther reason, however,
which was intelligible to the author of Genesis, and which is
fondly dwelt on in succeeding books of the Bible, depends on the
idea that the Creator himself is not indifferent to the
marvellous structures, instincts, and powers which he has
bestowed upon the lower races of animals.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Witness the answer of the Almighty to Job, when he spake out of the whirlwind to
vindicate his own plans in creation and providence; and brought
before the patriarch a long train of animals, explaining and
dwelling on the structure and powers of each, in contrast with
the puny efforts and rude artificial contrivances of man. Witness
also the preservation, in the rocks, of the fossil remains of
extinct creatures, as if he who made them was unwilling that the
evidence of their existence should perish, and purposely
treasured them through all the revolutions of the earth, that
through them men might magnify his name. The Psalmist would
almost appear to have had all these thoughts before his mind when
he poured out his wonder in the 104th Psalm:</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left: 10%;">"O Lord, how manifold are thy works!<br />
In wisdom hast thou made them all.<br />
The earth is full of thy riches;<br />
So is this wide and great sea,<br />
Wherein are moving things innumerable,<br />
Creatures both small and great.<br />
There go the ships [or "floating animals"];<br />
There is leviathan, which thou hast formed to sport therein:<br />
That thou givest them they gather.<br />
Thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good;<br />
Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled;<br />
Thou takest away their breath, they return to their dust.<br />
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created,<br />
And thou renewest the face of the earth."</p>

<p>There are, however, good reasons to believe that, in the plans of
divine wisdom, the long periods in which the earth was occupied
by the inferior races were necessary to its subsequent adaptation
to the residence of man. To these periods our present continents
gradually grew up in all their variety and beauty. The materials
of old rocks were comminuted and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
mixed to form fertile soils,
<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
and stores of mineral products were accumulated to
enable man to earn his subsistence and the blessings of
civilization by the sweat of his brow. If it pleased the Almighty
during these preparatory stages to replenish the land and sea
with living things full of life and beauty and happiness, who
shall venture to criticise his procedure, or to say to Him, "What
doest thou?"</p>

<p>It would be decidedly wrong, in the present state of that which
is popularly called science, to omit to inquire here what
relation to the work of the fifth creative day those theories of
development and evolution which have obtained so great currency
may bear. The long time employed in the introduction of the lower
animals, the use of the terms "make" and "form," instead of
"create," and the expression "let the waters bring forth," may
well be understood as countenancing some form of mediate
creation, or of "creation by law," or "theistic evolution," as it
has been termed; but they give no countenance to the idea either
of the spontaneous evolution of living beings under the influence
of merely physical causes and without creative intervention, or
of the transmutation of one kind of animal into another. Still,
with reference to this last idea, it is plain that revelation
gives us no definition of species as distinguished from varieties
or races, so that there is nothing to prevent the supposition
that, within certain limits indicated by the expression "after
its kind," animals or plants may have been so constituted as to
vary greatly in the progress of geological time.</p>

<p>If we ask whether any thing is known to science which can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
give even a decided probability to the notion that living beings are
parts of an undirected evolution proceeding under merely dead
insentient forces, and without intention, the answer must be
emphatically no.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere fully discussed these questions, and may here
make some general statements as to certain scientific facts which
at present bar the way against the hypothesis of evolution as
applied to life, and especially against that form of it to which
Darwin and his disciples have given so great prominence.</p>

<p>1. The albuminous or protoplasmic material, which seems to be
necessary to the existence of every living being, is known to us
as a product only of the action of previously living protoplasm.
Though it is often stated that the production of albumen from its
elements is a process not differing from the formation of water
or any other inorganic material from its elements, this statement
is false in fact, since, though many so-called organic substances
have been produced by chemical processes, no particle of either
living or non-living organizable matter of the nature of
protoplasm has ever been so produced. The origin, therefore, of
this albuminous matter is as much a mystery to us at present as
that of any of the chemical elements.</p>

<p>2. Though some animals and plants are very simple in their
visible structure, they all present vital properties not to be
found in dead albuminous matter, and no mode is known whereby the
properties of life can be communicated to dead matter. All the
experiments hitherto made, and very eminently those recently
performed by Pasteur, Tyndall, and Dallinger, lead to the
conclusion that even the simplest living beings can be produced
only from germs originating in previously living organisms of
similar structure. The simplest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
living organisms are thus to science ultimate facts, for which it can not account except
conjecturally.</p>

<p>3. No case is certainly known in human experience where any
species of animal or plant has been so changed as to assume all
the characters of a new species. Species are thus practically to
science unchangeable units, the origin of which we have as yet no
means of tracing.</p>

<p>4. Though the general history of animal life in time bears a
certain resemblance to the development of the individual animal
from the embryo, there is no reason whatever to believe that this
is more than a mere relation of analogy, arising from the fact
that in both cases the law of procedure is to pass from the
simpler forms to the more complex, and from the more generalized
to the more specialized. The external conditions and details of
the two kinds of series are altogether different, and become more
so the more they are investigated. This shows that the causes can
not have been similar.</p>

<p>5. In tracing back animals and groups of animals in geological
time, we find that they always end without any link of connection
with previous beings, and in circumstances which render any such
connections improbable. In the work of our next creative day, the
series of animals preceding the modern horse has been cited as a
good instance of probable evolution; but not only are the members
of the series so widely separated in space and time that no
connection can be traced, but the earliest of them, the
<i>Orohippus</i>, would require, on the theory, to have been preceded
by a previous series extending so far back that it is impossible,
under any supposition of the imperfection of our present
knowledge, to consider such extension probable. The same
difficulty applies to every case of tracing back any specific
form either of animal or plant. This general result proves, as I
have elsewhere attempted to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
show,
<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
that the introduction of
the various animal types must have been abrupt, and under some
influence quite different from that of evolution.</p>

<p>These are what I would term the five fatal objections to
evolution as at present held, as a means of accounting for the
introduction and succession of animals. To what extent they may
be weakened or strengthened by the future progress of science it
is impossible to say, but so long as they exist it is mere folly
and presumption to affirm that modern science supports the
doctrine of evolution. There can be no doubt, however, that the
Bible leaves us perfectly free to inquire as to the plan and
method of the Creator, and that, whatever discoveries we may
make, we shall find that his plans are orderly, methodical, and
continuous, and not of the nature of an arbitrary patchwork.</p>

<p>Though science as yet gives us no certain laws for the
introduction of new specific types, it indicates certain possible
modes of the origination of varieties, races, and sub-species of
previously existing types. One of these is that struggle for
existence against adverse external conditions, which, however,
has been harped upon too exclusively by the Darwinian school, and
which will give chiefly depauperated and degraded forms. Another
is that expansion under exceptionally favorable conditions which
arises where species are admitted to wider new areas of
geographical range and more abundant and varied means of
sustenance. Land animals and plants must have experienced this in
times of continental elevation; marine animals and plants in
times of continental depression. Another is the tendency to what
has been called reproductive retardation and acceleration which
species undergo under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
conditions exceptionally unfavorable or
favorable, and which in some modern aquatic animals produces
differences so great that members of the same species have
sometimes been placed in different genera. Lastly, it is
conceivable that species may have been so constructed that after
a certain number of generations they may spontaneously undergo
either abrupt or gradual changes, similar to those which the
individual undergoes at certain stages of growth. This last
furnishes the only true analogy possible between embryology and
geological succession.</p>

<p>While, however, science is silent as to the production of new
specific types, and only gives us indications as to the origin of
varieties and races, it is curious that the Bible suggests three
methods in which new organisms may be, and according to it have
been introduced by the Creator. The first is that of immediate
and direct creation, as when God created the great Tanninim. The
second is that of mediate creation, through the materials
previously existing, as when he said, "Let the land bring forth
plants," or "Let the waters bring forth animals." The third is
that of production from a previous organism by power other than
that of ordinary reproduction, as in the origination of Eve from
Adam, and the miraculous conception of Jesus. These are the only
points in which its teachings approach the limits of speculations
as to evolution, and they certainly leave scope enough for the
legitimate inquiries of science.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:90%;">THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND MAN.</span><br /></h2>


<p style="font-size:80%;text-indent:3em;text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
"And God said, Let the land bring forth animals
after their kinds; the herbivora, the reptiles, and the carnivora, after their
kinds; and it was so. And God made carnivorous mammals after their kinds,
and herbivorous mammals after their kinds, and every reptile of the land after
its kind; and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;text-indent:3em;text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
"And God said, Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness; and
let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, and over
the herbivora and over all the land. So God created man in his own image,
in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
And God blessed them; and God said, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish
the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over
the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;text-indent:3em;text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">
"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree
in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
shall be for food, and to every beast of the earth and to
every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon
the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green
herb for meat; and it was so. And God saw every thing that
he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And evening and
morning were the sixth day."&mdash;Genesis i., 24-31.</p>


<p>The creation of animals, unlike that of plants, occupies two
days. Here our attention is restricted to the inhabitants of the
<i>land</i>, and chiefly to their higher forms. Several new names are
introduced to our notice, which I have endeavored to translate as
literally as possible by introducing zoological terms where those
in common use were deficient.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
1. The first tribe of animals noticed here is named <i>Bhemah</i>,
"cattle" in our version; and in the Septuagint "quadrupeds" in
one of the verses, and "cattle" in the other. Both of these
senses are of common occurrence in the Scriptures, cattle or
domesticated animals being usually designated by this word; while
in other passages, as in 1 Kings iv., 33, where Solomon is said
to have written a treatise on "<i>beasts</i>, fowls, creeping things,
and fishes," it appears to include all the mammalia.
Notwithstanding this wide range of meaning, however, there are
passages, and these of the greatest authority in reference to our
present subject, in which it strictly means the herbivorous
mammals, and which show that when it was necessary to distinguish
these from the predaceous or carnivorous tribes this term was
specially employed. In Leviticus xi., 22-27, we have a
specification of all the Bhemoth that might and might not be used
for food. It includes all the true ruminants, with the coney, the
hare, and the hog, animals of the rodent and pachydermatous
orders. The carnivorous quadrupeds are designated by a different
generic term. In this chapter of Leviticus, therefore, which
contains the only approach to a system in natural history to be
found in the Bible, <i>bhemah</i> is strictly a synonym of
<i>herbivora</i>, including especially ungulates and rodents. That
this is its proper meaning here is confirmed by the
considerations that in this place it can denote but a part of the
land quadrupeds, and that the idea of cattle or domesticated
animals would be an anachronism. At the same time there need be
no objection to the view that the especial capacity of ruminants
and other herbivora for domestication is connected with the use
of the word in this place.</p>

<p>2. The word <i>remes</i>, "creeping things" in our version, as we have
already shown, is a very general term, referring to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
power of motion possessed by animals, especially on the surface of the
ground. It here in all probability refers to the additional types
of terrestrial reptiles, and other creatures lower than the
mammals, introduced in this period.</p>

<p>3. The compound term (<i>hay'th-eretz</i>) which I have ventured to
render "carnivora," is literally animal of the land; but though
thus general in its meaning, it is here evidently intended to
denote a particular tribe of animals inhabiting the land, and not
included in the scope of the two words already noticed. In other
parts of Scripture this term is used in the sense of a "wild
beast." In a few places, like the other terms already noticed, it
is used of all kinds of animals, but that above stated is its
general meaning, and perfectly accords with the requirements of
the passage.</p>

<p>The creation of the sixth day therefore includes&mdash;1st, the
herbivorous mammalia; 2d, a variety of terrestrial reptilia, and
other lower forms not included in the work of the previous day;
3d, the carnivorous mammalia. It will be observed that the order
in the two verses is different. In verse 24th it is herbivora,
"creeping things," and carnivora. In verse 25th it is carnivora,
herbivora, and "creeping things." One of these may, as in the
account of the fifth day, indicate the order of <i>time</i> in the
creation, and the other the order of <i>rank</i> in the animals made,
or there may have been two divisions of the work, in the earlier
of which herbivorous animals took the lead, and in the later
those that are carnivorous. In either case we may infer that the
herbivora predominated in the earlier creations of the period.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to say this period corresponds with the
Tertiary or Cainozoic era of geologists. The coincidences are
very marked and striking. As already stated, though in the later
secondary period there were great facilities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
for the preservation of mammals in the strata then being deposited, only
a few small species of the humblest order have been found; and
the occurrence of the higher orders of this class is to some
extent precluded by the fact that the place in nature now
occupied by the mammals was then provided for by the vast
development of the reptile tribes. At the very beginning of the
tertiary period all this was changed; most of the gigantic
reptiles had disappeared, and terrestrial mammals of large size
and high organization had taken their place. Perhaps no
geological change is more striking and remarkable than the sudden
disappearance of the reptilian fauna at the close of the
mesozoic, and the equally abrupt appearance of numerous species
of large mammals, and this not in one region only, but over both
the great continents, and not only where a sudden break occurs in
the series of formations, but also where, as in Western America,
they pass gradually into each other. During the whole tertiary
period this predominance of the mammalia continued; and as the
mesozoic was the period of giant reptiles, so the tertiary was
that of great mammals. It is a singular and perhaps not
accidental coincidence that so many of the early tertiary mammals
known to us are large herbivora, such as would be included in the
Hebrew word <i>bhemah</i>; and that in the book of Job the
hippopotamus is called <i>behemoth</i>, the plural form being
apparently used to denote that this animal is the chief of the
creatures known under the general term <i>bhemah</i>, while geology
informs us that the prevailing order of mammals in the older
tertiary period was that of the ungulates, and that many of the
extinct creatures of this group are very closely allied to the
hippopotamus. Behemoth thus figures in the book of Job, not only
as at the time a marked illustration of creative power, but to
our farther knowledge also as a singular remnant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of an extinct gigantic race. It is at least curious that while in the fifth day
great reptiles like those of the secondary rocks form the burden
of the work, in the sixth we have a term which so directly
reminds us of those gigantic pachyderms which figure so largely
in the tertiary period. Large carnivora also occur in the
tertiary formations, and there are some forms of reptile life,
as, for example, the serpents, which first appear in the
tertiary.</p>

<p>I may refer to any popular text-book of geology in evidence of
the exact conformity of this to the progress of mammalian life,
as we now know it in detail from the study of the successive
tertiary deposits. The following short summary from Dana, though
written several years ago, still expresses the main features of
the case:</p>

<p>"The quadrupeds did not all come forth together. Large and
powerful herbivorous species first take possession of the earth,
with only a few small carnivora. These pass away. Other herbivora
with a larger proportion of carnivora next appear. These also are
exterminated; and so with others. Then the carnivora appear in
vast numbers and power, and the herbivora also abound. Moreover
these races attain a magnitude and number far surpassing all that
now exist, as much so indeed, on all the continents, North and
South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, as the old
mastodon, twenty feet long and nine feet high, exceeds the modern
buffalo. Such, according to geology, was the age of mammals, when
the brute species existed in their greatest magnificence, and
brutal ferocity had free play; when the dens of bears and hyenas,
prowling tigers and lions far larger than any now existing,
covered Britain and Europe. Mammoths and mastodons wandered over
the plains of North America, huge sloth-like Megatheria passed
their sluggish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
lives on the pampas of South America, and
elephantine marsupials strolled about Australia.</p>

<p>"As the mammalian age draws to a close, the ancient carnivora and
herbivora of that era all pass away, excepting, it is believed, a
few that are useful to man. New creations of smaller size peopled
the groves; the vegetation received accessions to its foliage,
fruit-trees and flowers, and the seas brighter forms of water
life. This we know from comparisons with the fossils of the
preceding mammalian age. There was at this time no chaotic
upturning, but only the opening of creation to its fullest
expansion; and so in Genesis no new day is begun, it is still the
<i>sixth day</i>."</p>

<p>The creation of man is prefaced by expressions implying
deliberation and care. It is not said, "Let the earth bring
forth" man, but let us form or fashion man. This marks the
relative importance of the human species, and the heavenly origin
of its nobler immaterial part. Man is also said to have been
"created," implying that in his constitution there was something
new and not included in previous parts of the work, even in its
material. Man was created, as the Hebrew literally reads, the
shadow and similitude of God&mdash;the greatest of the visible
manifestations of Deity in the lower world&mdash;the reflected image
of his Maker, and, under the Supreme Lawgiver, the delegated
ruler of the earth. Now for the first time was the earth tenanted
by a being capable of comprehending the purposes and plans of
Jehovah, of regarding his works with intelligent admiration, and
of shadowing forth the excellences of his moral nature. For
countless ages the earth had been inhabited by creatures
wonderful in their structures and instincts, and mutely
testifying, as their buried remains still do, to the Creator's
glory; but limited within a narrow range of animal propensities,
and having no power of raising a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
thought or aspiration toward the Being who made them. Now, however, man enters on the scene,
and the sons of God, who had shouted for joy when the first land
emerged from the bosom of the deep, saw the wondrous spectacle of
a spiritual nature analogous to their own, united to a corporeal
frame constructed on the same general type with the higher of
those irrational creatures whose presence on earth they had so
long witnessed.</p>

<p>Man was to rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air,
and the <i>bhemah</i> or herbivorous animals. The carnivorous
creatures are not mentioned, and possibly were not included in
man's dominion. We shall find an explanation of this farther on.
The nature of man's dominion we are left to infer. In his state
of innocence it must have been a mild and gentle sway,
interfering in no respect wilts the free exercise of the powers
of enjoyment bestowed on animals by the Creator, a rule akin to
that which a merciful man exercises over a domesticated animal,
and which some animals are capable of repaying with a warm and
devoted affection. Now, however, man's rule has become a tyranny.
"The whole creation groans" because of it. He desolates the face
of nature wherever he appears, unsettling the nice balance of
natural agencies, and introducing remediless confusion and
suffering among the lower creatures, even when in the might of
his boasted civilization he professes to renovate and improve the
face of nature. He retains enough of the image of his Maker to
enable him to a great extent to assert his dominion, and to
aspire after a restoration of his original paradise, but he has
lost so much that the power which he retains is necessarily
abused to selfish ends.</p>

<p>Man, like the other creatures, was destined to be fruitful and
multiply and replenish the earth. We are also informed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
in chapter second that he was placed in a "garden," a chosen spot in
the alluvial plains of Western Asia, belonging to the later
geological formations, and thus prepared by the whole series of
prior geological changes, replenished with all things useful to
him, and containing nothing hurtful, at least in so far as the
animal creation was concerned. These facts, taken in connection,
lead to grave questions. How is the happy and innocent state of
man consistent with the contemporaneous existence of carnivorous
and predaceous animals, which, as both Scripture and geology
state, were created in abundance in the sixth day? How, when
confined to a limited region, could he increase and multiply and
replenish the earth? These questions, which have caused no little
perplexity, are easily solved when brought into the light of our
modern knowledge of nature. 1. Every large region of the earth is
inhabited by a group of animals differing in the proportions of
identical species, and in the presence of distinct species, from
the groups inhabiting other districts. There is also sufficient
reason to conclude that all animals and plants have spread from
certain local centres of creation, in which certain groups of
species have been produced and allowed to extend themselves,
until they met and became intermingled with species extending
from other centres. Now the district of Asia, in the vicinity of
the Euphrates and Tigris, to which the Scripture assigns the
origin of the human race, is the centre to which we can with the
greatest probability trace several of the species of animals and
plants most useful to man, and it lies near the confines of
warmer and colder regions of distribution in the Old World, and
also near the boundary of the Asiatic and European regions. At
the period under consideration it may have been peopled with a
group of animals specially suited to association with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the progenitors of mankind. 2. To remove all zoological difficulties
from the position of primeval man in his state of innocence, we
have but to suppose, in accordance with all the probabilities of
the case, that man was created along with a group of creatures
adapted to contribute to his happiness, and having no tendency to
injure or annoy; and that it is the formation of these
creatures&mdash;the group of his own centre of creation&mdash;that is
especially noticed in Genesis ii., 19, <i>et seq.</i>, where God is
represented as forming them out of the ground and exhibiting them
to Adam; a passage otherwise superfluous, and indeed tending to
confuse the meaning of the document. 3. The difficulty attending
the early extension of the human race is at once obviated by the
geological doctrine of the extinction of species. We know that in
past geological periods large and important groups of species
have become extinct, and have been replaced by new groups
extending from new centres; and we know that this process has
removed, in early geological periods, many creatures that would
have been highly injurious to human interests had they remained.
Now the group of species created with man being the latest
introduced, we may infer, on geological grounds, that it would
have extended itself within the spheres of older zoological and
botanical districts, and would have replaced their species,
which, in the ordinary operation of natural laws, may have been
verging toward extinction. Thus not only man, but the Eden in
which he dwelt, with all its animals and plants, would have
gradually encroached on the surrounding wilderness, until man's
happy and peaceful reign had replaced that of the ferocious
beasts that preceded him in dominion, and had extended at least
over all the temperate region of the earth. 4. The cursing of the
ground for man's sake, on his fall from innocence, would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
thus consist in the permission given to the predaceous animals and the
thorns and the briers of other centres of creation to invade his
Eden; or, in his own expulsion, to contend with the animals and
plants which were intended to have given way and become extinct
before him. Thus the fall of man would produce an arrestment in
the progress of the earth in that last great revolution which
would have converted it into an Eden; and the anomalies of its
present state consist, according to Scripture, in a mixture of
the conditions of the tertiary with those of the human period. 5.
Though there is good ground for believing that man was to have
been exempted from the general law of mortality, we can not infer
that any such exemption would have been enjoyed by his companion
animals; we only know that he himself would have been free from
all annoyance and injury and decay from external causes. We may
also conclude that, while Eden was sufficient for his habitation,
the remainder of the earth would continue, just as in the earlier
tertiary periods, under the dominion of the predaceous mammals,
reptiles, and birds. 6. The above views enable us on the one hand
to avoid the difficulties that attend the admission of predaceous
animals into Eden, and on the other the still more formidable
difficulties that attend the attempt to exclude them altogether
from the Adamic world. They also illustrate the geological fact
that many animals, contemporaneous with man, extend far back into
the Tertiary period. These are creatures not belonging to the
Edenic centre of creation, but introduced in an earlier part of
the sixth day, and now permitted to exist along with man in his
fallen state. I have stated these supposed conditions of the
Adamic creation briefly, and with as little illustration as
possible, that they may connectedly strike the mind of the
reader.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Each of these statements is in harmony with the
Scriptural narrative on the one hand, and with geology on the
other; and, taken together, they afford an intelligible history
of the introduction of man. If a geologist were to state, <i>&agrave;
priori</i>, the conditions proper to the creation of any important
species, he could only say&mdash;the preparation or selection of some
region of the earth for it, and its production along with a group
of plants and animals suited to it. These are precisely the
conditions implied in the Scriptural account of the creation of
Adam.
<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
The difficulties of the subject have arisen from
supposing, contrary to the narrative itself, that the conditions
necessary for Eden must in the first instance have extended over
the whole earth, and that the creatures with which man is in his
present dispersion brought into contact must necessarily have
been his companions there. One would think that many persons
derive their idea of the first man in Eden from nursery
picture-books; for the Bible gives no countenance to the idea
that all the animals in the world were in Eden. On the contrary,
it asserts that a selection was made both in the case of animals
and plants, and that this Edenic assemblage of creatures
constituted man's associates in his state of primeval innocence.</p>

<p>The food of animals is specified at the close of the work of this
day. The grant to man is every herb bearing seed, and every
fruit-tree. That to the lower animals is more extensive&mdash;every
green herb. This can not mean that every animal in the earth was
herbivorous. It may refer to the group of animals associated with
man in Eden, and this is most likely the intention of the writer;
but if it includes the animals of the whole earth, we may be
certain, from the express
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
mention of carnivorous creatures in
the work of the fifth and sixth days, that it indicates merely
the general fact that the support of the whole animal kingdom is
based on vegetation.
</p>

<p>
A most important circumstance in connection with the work of the
sixth day is that it witnessed the creation both of man and the
mammalia. A fictitious writer would probably have exalted man by
assigning to him a separate day, and by placing the whole animal
kingdom together in respect to time. He would be all the more
likely to do this, if unacquainted, as most ignorant persons as
well as literary men are, with the importance and teeming
multitudes of the lower tribes of animals, and with the typical
identity of the human frame with that of the higher animals.
Moses has not done so, we are at liberty to suppose, because the
vision of creation had it otherwise; and modern geology has amply
vindicated him in this by its disclosure of the intimate
connection of the human with the tertiary period; and has shown
in this as in other instances that truth and not "accommodation"
was the object of the sacred writer. While, as already stated,
many existing species extend far back into the tertiary period,
showing that the earth has been visited by no universal
catastrophe since the first creation of mammals; on the other
hand, we can not with certainty trace any existing species back
beyond the commencement of the tertiary era. Geology and
revelation, therefore, coincide in referring the creation of man
to the close of the period in which mammals were introduced and
became predominant, and in establishing a marked separation
between that period and the preceding one in which the lower
animals held undisputed sway. This coincidence, while it
strengthens the probability that the creative days were long
periods, opposes an almost insurmountable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
obstacle to every other hypothesis of reconciliation with geological science.</p>

<p>At the close of this day the Creator again reviews his work, and
pronounces it good. Step by step the world had been evolved from
a primeval chaos, through many successive physical changes and
long series of organized beings. It had now reached its acme of
perfection, and had received its most illustrious tenant,
possessing an organism excelling all others in majesty and
beauty, and an immaterial soul the shadow of the glorious Creator
himself. Well might the angels sing, when the long-protracted
work was thus grandly completed:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;text-indent:10em;font-size:90%">"Thrice happy man,<br />
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanced,<br />
Created in his image, there to dwell<br />
And worship him, and in reward to rule<br />
Over his works in earth, or sea, or air,<br />
And multiply a race of worshippers<br />
Holy and just; thrice happy, if they know<br />
Their happiness and persevere upright."</p>

<p>The Hebrew idea of the golden age of Eden is pure and exalted. It
consists in the enjoyment of the favor of God, and of all that is
beautiful and excellent in his works. God and nature are the
whole. Nor is it merely a rude, unintelligent, sensuous
enjoyment. Man primeval is not a lazy savage gathering acorns. He
is made in the image of the Creator; he is to keep and dress his
garden, and it is furnished with every plant good for food and
pleasant to the sight. In the midst of our material civilization
we need to disabuse ourselves of some prejudices before we can
realize the fact that man, without the arts of life or any need
of them, is not necessarily a barbarian or a savage. Yet even
Adam must have been an agriculturist with strong and willing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
hands, and must have had some need of agricultural implements
such as those with which the least civilized of his descendants
have been wont to till the soil. Still, without art or with very
little of it, he could enjoy all that is beautiful and grand in
nature, and could rise from the observation of nature to
communion with God. We need the more to realize this, inasmuch as
there seems so strong a tendency to confound material
civilization with higher culture, and to hold that man primeval
must have been low and debased simply because he may have had no
temples and no machinery. We must remember that he had nature,
which is higher than fine art, and that when in harmony with his
surroundings he may have had no need either of exhausting labor
or of mechanical contrivances. Farther, in the contemplation of
nature and in seeking after God, he had higher teachers than our
boasted civilization can claim.</p>

<p>Alas for fallen man, with his poor civilization gathered little
by little from the dust of earth, and his paltry art that halts
immeasurably behind nature. How little is he able even to
appreciate the high estate of his great ancestor. The world of
fallen men has worshipped art too much, reverenced and studied
God and nature too little. The savage displays the lowest taste
when he admires the rude figures which he paints on his face or
his garments more than the glorious painting that adorns nature;
yet even he acknowledges the pre-eminent excellence of nature by
imitating her forms and colors, and by adapting her painted
plumes and flowers to his own use. There is a wide interval,
including many gradations, between this low position and that of
the cultivated amateur or artist. The art of the latter makes a
nearer approach to the truly beautiful, inasmuch as it more
accurately represents the geometric and organic forms and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the coloring of nature; and inasmuch as it devises ideal combinations
not found in the actual world; which ideal combinations, however,
are beautiful or monstrous just as they realize or violate the
harmonies of nature. It is only the highest culture that brings
man back to his primitive refinement.</p>

<p>Art takes her true place when she sits at the feet of nature, and
brings her students to drink in its beauties, that they may
endeavor, however imperfectly, to reproduce them. On the other
hand, the student of nature must not content himself with
"writing Latin names on white paper," wherewith to label nature's
productions, but must rise to the contemplation of the order and
beauty of the Cosmos as a revelation of Divinity. Both will thus
rise to that highest taste which will enable them to appreciate
not only the elegance of individual forms, but their structure,
their harmonies, their grouping and their relations, their
special adaptation, and their places as parts of a great system.
Thus art will attain that highest point in which it displays
original genius, without violating natural truth and unity, and
nature will be regarded as the highest art.</p>

<p>Much is said and done in our time with reference to the
cultivation of popular taste for fine art as a means of
civilization; and this, so far as it goes, is well; but the only
sure path to the highest taste-education is the cultivation of
the study of nature. This is also an easier branch of education,
provided the instructors have sufficient knowledge. Good works of
art are rare and costly; but good works of nature are everywhere
around us, waiting to be examined. Such education, popularly
diffused, would react on the efforts of art. It would enable a
widely extended public to appreciate real excellence, and would
cause works of art to be valued just in proportion to the extent
to which they realize
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
or deviate from natural truth and unity. I
do not profess to speak authoritatively on such subjects, but I
confess that the strong impression on my mind is that neither the
revered antique models, nor the practice and principles of the
generality of modern art reformers, would endure such criticism;
and that if we could combine popular enthusiasm for art with
scientific appreciation of nature, a new and better art might
arise from the union.</p>

<p>I may appear to dwell too long upon this topic; but my excuse
must be that it leads to a true estimate both of natural history
and of the sacred Scriptures. The study of nature guides to those
large views of the unity and order of creation which alone are
worthy of a being of the rank of man, and which lead him to
adequate conceptions of the Creator; but the truly wise recognize
three grades of beauty. First, that of art, which, in its higher
efforts, can raise ordinary minds far above themselves. Secondly,
that of nature, which, in its most common objects, must transcend
the former, since its artist is that God of whose infinite mind
the genius of the artist is only a faint reflection. Thirdly,
that pre-eminent beauty of moral goodness revealed only in the
spiritual nature of the Supreme. The first is one of the natural
resources of fallen man in his search for happiness. The second
was man's joy in his primeval innocence. The third is the
inheritance of man redeemed. It is folly to place these on the
same level. It is greater folly to worship either or both of the
first without regard to the last. It is true wisdom to aspire to
the last, and to regard nature as the handmaid of piety, art as
but the handmaid of nature.</p>

<p>Nature to the unobservant is merely a mass of things more or less
beautiful or interesting, but without any definite order or
significance. An observer soon arrives at the conclusion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
that it is a series of circling changes, ever returning to the same
points, ever renewing their courses, under the action of
invariable laws. But if he rests here, he falls infinitely short
of the idea of the Cosmos, and stands on the brink of the
profound error of eternal succession. A little further progress
conducts him to the inviting field of special adaptation and
mutual relation of things. He finds that nothing is without its
use; that every structure is most nicely adjusted to special
ends; that the supposed ceaseless circling of nature is merely
the continuous action of great powers, by which an infinity of
utilities are worked out&mdash;the great fly-wheel which, in its
unceasing and at first sight apparently aimless round, is giving
motion to thousands of reels and spindles and shuttles, that are
spinning and weaving, in all its varied patterns, the great web
of life.</p>

<p>But the observer, as he looks on this web, is surprised to find
that it has in its whole extent a wondrous pattern. He rises to
the contemplation of type in nature, a great truth to which
science has only lately opened its eyes. He begins dimly to
perceive that the Creator has from the beginning had a plan
before his mind, that this plan embraced various types or
patterns of existence; that on these patterns he has been working
out the whole system of nature, adapting each to all the variety
of uses by an infinity of minor modifications. That, in short,
whether he study the eye of a gnat or the structure of a mountain
chain, he sees not only objects of beauty and utility, but parts
of far-reaching plans of infinite wisdom, by which all objects,
however separated in time or space, are linked together.</p>

<p>How much of positive pleasure does that man lose who passes
through life absorbed with its wants and its artificialities, and
regarding with a "brute, unconscious gaze" the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
grand revelation of a higher intelligence in the outer world. It is only in an
approximation through our Divine Redeemer to the moral likeness
of God that we can be truly happy; but of the subsidiary
pleasures which we are here permitted to enjoy, the contemplation
of nature is one of the best and purest. It was the pleasure, the
show, the spectacle prepared for man in Eden, and how much true
philosophy and taste shine in the simple words that in paradise
God planted trees "pleasant to the sight," as well as "good for
food." Other things being equal, the nearer we can return to this
primitive taste, the greater will be our sensuous enjoyment, the
better the influence of our pleasures on our moral nature,
because they will then depend on the cultivation of tastes at
once natural and harmless, and will not lead us to communion with
and reverence for merely human genius, but will conduct us into
the presence of the infinite perfection of the Creator.</p>

<p>The Bible knows but one species of man. It is not said that men
were created after their species, as we read of the groups of
animals. Man was made, "male and female;" and in the fuller
details afterwards given in the second chapter&mdash;where the writer,
having finished his general narrative, commences his special
history of man&mdash;but one primitive pair is introduced to our
notice. We scarcely need the detailed tables of affiliation
afterward given, or the declaration of the apostle who preached
to the supposed autochthones of Athens, that "God has made of one
blood all nations," to assure us of the Scriptural unity of man.
If, therefore, there were any good reason to believe that man is
not of one but several origins, we must admit Moses to have been
very imperfectly informed. Nor, on the other hand, does the Bible
any more than geology allow us to assign a very high antiquity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
to the origin of man relatively to that of the earth on which he
dwells. The genealogical tables of the Bible may admit of some
limits of difference of opinion as to the age of the human world
or &aelig;on, and also of that of the deluge, from which man took his
second point of departure; but they do not allow us to put the
origin of man farther back than that of the present or modern
condition of our continents and the present races of animals.
They therefore limit us to the modern or quaternary period of
geology. The question of man's antiquity, so much agitated now,
demands, however, a separate and careful consideration; but we
must first devote a few pages to the simple statements of the
Bible respecting the Sabbath of creation and its relation to
human history.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br/><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">THE REST OF THE CREATOR.</span><br /></h2>


<p style="font-size:80%;text-indent:3em;text-align:left;font-weight:bold;">"And the
heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made, and he
rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it
God rested from all  his work which he had created to make."&mdash;Genesis ii., 1-3.</p>


<p>The end of the sixth day closed the work of creation properly so
called, as well as that of forming and arranging the things
created. The beginning of the seventh introduced a period which,
according to the views already stated, was to be occupied by the
continued increase and diffusion of man and the creatures under
his dominion, and by the gradual disappearance of tribes of
creatures unconnected with his well-being.</p>

<p>Science in this well accords with Scripture. No proof exists of
the production of a new species since the creation of man; and
all geological and arch&aelig;ological evidence points to him and a few
of the higher mammals as the newest of the creatures. There is,
on the other hand, good evidence that several species have become
extinct since his creation. Those who believe in the continuous
evolution of animals and men, it is true, can see no actual
termination of the process with the introduction of man; but even
they see that the appearance of a rational and moral being at
least changes the nature and order of the development. Nor can
they doubt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
that man is the last born of nature, and that the
whole animal creation is crowned by him as its capital or topmost
pinnacle. The later speculators on this subject have never
reached any truth beyond that long ago stated by the lamented
Edward Forbes&mdash;a most careful observer and accurate reasoner on
the more recent changes of the earth's surface. He infers, from
the distribution of species from their centres of creation, that
man is the latest product of creative power; or, in other words,
that none of those species or groups of species which he had been
able to trace to their centres, or the spots at which they
probably originated, appear to be of later or as late origin as
man. "This consideration," he says, "induces me to believe that
the last province in time was completed by the coming of man, and
to maintain an hypothesis that man stands unique in space and
time, himself equal to the sum of any pre-existing centre of
creation or of all&mdash;an hypothesis consistent with man's moral and
social position in the world."</p>

<p>The seventh day, then, was to have been that in which all the
happiness, beauty, and perfection of the others were to have been
concentrated. But an element of instability was present in the
being who occupied the summit of the animal scale. Not regulated
by blind and unerring instincts, but a free agent, with a high
intellectual and moral nature, and liable to be acted on by
temptation from without; under such influence he lost his moral
balance in stretching out his hand to grasp the peculiar powers
of Deity, and fell beyond the hope of
self-redemption&mdash;perpetuating, by one of those laws which
regulate the transmission of mixed corporeal and spiritual
natures, his degradation to every generation of his species. And
so God's great work was marred, and all his plans seemed to be
foiled, when they had just reached their completion.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Thus far science might carry us unaided; for there is not a true
naturalist, however skeptical as to revealed religion, who does
not feel in his inmost heart the disjointed state of the present
relations of man to nature; the natural wreck that results from
his artificial modes of life, the long trains of violations of
the symmetry of nature that follow in the wake of his most
boasted achievements. But here natural science stops; and just as
we have found that, in tracing back the world's history, the
Bible carries us much farther than geology, so science, having
led us to suspect the fallen state of man, leaves us henceforth
to the teaching of revelation. And how glorious that teaching!
God did not find himself baffled&mdash;his resources are infinite&mdash;he
had foreseen and prepared for all this apparent evil; and out of
the moral wreck he proceeds to work out the grand process of
<i>redemption</i>, which is the especial object of the seventh day,
and which will result in the production of a new heaven and a new
earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. In the seventh, as in the
former days, the evening precedes the morning. For four thousand
years the world groped in its darkness&mdash;a darkness tenanted by
moral monsters as powerful and destructive as the old pre-Adamite
reptiles. The Sun of Righteousness at length arose, and the
darkness began to pass away; but eighteen centuries have elapsed,
and we still see but the gray dawn of morning, which we yet
firmly believe will brighten into a glorious day that shall know
no succeeding night.

<a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The seventh day is the modern or human era in geology; and,
though it can not yet boast of any physical changes so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
great as those of past periods, it is still of much interest, as affording
the facts on which we must depend for explanations of past
changes; and as immediately connected in time with those later
tertiary periods which afford so many curious problems to the
geological student. The actual connection of the human with
preceding periods is still involved in some obscurity; and, as we
shall see, there has recently been a strong tendency to throw
back the origin of man into prehistoric ages of enormous length,
on grounds which are, however, much less certain than is commonly
imagined. This question we have to examine; but before entering
upon it may shortly sketch the actual import of the statements of
the Hebrew Scriptures respecting what may be called the
prehistoric duration of the human species. This is the more
necessary, as the most crude notions seem very widely to prevail
on the subject. I shall, therefore, in this place notice some
general facts deducible from the Bible, and which may be useful
in appreciating the true relation of the human era to those which
preceded it. It will be understood that I shall endeavor merely
to present a picture of what the Bible actually teaches, and
which any one can verify by reading the book of Genesis.</p>

<p>1. The local centre of creation of the human species, and
probably of a group of creatures coeval with it, was Eden; a
country of which the Scriptures give a somewhat minute
geographical description. It was evidently a district of Western
Asia; and, from its possession of several important rivers,
rather a region or large territory than a limited spot, such as
many, who have discussed the question of the site of Eden, seem
to suppose. In this view it is a matter of no moment to fix its
site more nearly than the indication of the Bible that it
included the sources and probably large portions of the valleys
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
of the Tigris, the Euphrates, and perhaps the Oxus and Jaxartes.
Into the minor difficulties respecting the site of Eden it would
be unprofitable to enter, and it will matter little if we accept
that view, which, however, I think less probable, that it was
placed in the lower part of the valley of the Euphrates. I may
merely mention one particular of the Biblical description,
because it throws light on the great antiquity of this
geographical delineation, and has been strangely misconceived by
expositors&mdash;the relation of those rivers to Cush or Ethiopia and
Havilah, a tribal name derived from that of a grandson of Cush.
On consulting the tenth chapter of Genesis, it will be found that
the Cushites under Nimrod, very soon after the deluge, are stated
to have pushed their migrations and conquests along the Tigris to
the northward, and established there the first empire. It is
probably this primitive Cushite empire, called Ethiopia in our
translation, which in the epoch of the description of Eden
occupied the Euphratean valley, and being bounded on one side by
the river called Gihon, was thus believed to extend over the old
site of Eden. Thus the Cush or Ethiopia of the description has no
direct connection with the African Ethiopia, and speculations
based on such a supposed connection are groundless. On the other
hand this feature furnishes an interesting coincidence with other
parts of Genesis, and throws light on many obscure points in the
early history of man; and since this Cushite empire had perished
even before the time of Moses, it indicates a still more ancient
tradition respecting the primeval abode of our species.</p>

<p>2. Before the deluge this region must have been the seat of a
dense population, which, according to the Biblical account, must
have made considerable advances in the arts, and at the same time
sunk very low in moral debasement.
<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Whether any remains of the central portions of this ancient population or its works
exist will probably not be determined with absolute certainty
till we have accurate geological investigations of the whole
country in the neighborhood of the Caspian Sea and along the
great rivers of Western Asia, though there is nothing
unreasonable in the belief that some of the old prehistoric men
whose remains are discovered in caves and river gravels in Europe
may belong to the antediluvian race. Should such remains be
found, we might infer, from the extreme longevity and other
characteristics assigned to the antediluvians, that their
skeletons would present peculiarities entitling them to be
considered a well-marked variety of the human species, and this
not of a low type of physical organization. We may also infer
that the family of man very early divided into two races&mdash;one
retaining in greater purity the moral endowments of the species,
the other excelling in the mechanical and fine arts; and that
there were rude and savage outlying communities of men then as at
present. If the so-called pal&aelig;olithic men of Europe are
antediluvian, they were probably of such outlying tribes, and
possibly of the mixed race which sprung up in the later
antediluvian age, and who are described as mighty men physically,
and men of violence. It would be quite natural that this
intermixture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
of the Sethite and Cainite races should produce a
race excelling both in energy and physical endowments&mdash;the
"giants" that were in those days.
<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
If any remains of the two central nations of the antediluvian period are ever discovered,
we may confidently anticipate that the distinctive
characteristics of these races may be detected in their osseous
structures as well as in their works of art. Farther, it is to be
inferred from notices in the fourth chapter of Genesis, that
before the deluge there was both a nomadic and a settled
population, and that the principal seat of the Cainite, or more
debased yet energetic branch of the human family, was to the
eastward of the site of Eden. No intimations are given by which
the works of art of antediluvian times could be distinguished
from those of later periods; but that curious summary of the
treasures of antediluvian man contained in the notice that the
land of Havilah produced gold and agate and pearl (Gen. ii., 12)
would lead us to believe that the early antediluvian age was on
the whole an age of stone, in which flint for weapons, and gold
and shell wampum for ornaments, were the leading kinds of wealth.
On the other hand, the notices of antediluvian metallurgy, and
the building and construction of the ark, would lead us to infer
that the later antediluvians had attained to much perfection in
some constructive arts&mdash;a conclusion which harmonizes with the
otherwise inexplicable perfection of such art soon after the
deluge, as evidenced not only by the story of Babel, but also by
the early works of the Assyrians and Egyptians.</p>

<p>3. When the antediluvian population had fully proved itself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
unfit to enter into the divine scheme of moral renovation, it was
swept away by a fearful physical catastrophe. The deluge might,
in all its relations, furnish material for an entire treatise. I
may remark here, as its most important geological peculiarity,
that it was evidently a <i>local</i> convulsion. The object, that of
destroying the human race and the animal population of its
peculiar centre of creation, the preservation of specimens of
these creatures in the ark, and the physical requirements of the
case, necessitate this conclusion, which is now accepted by the
best Biblical expositors,
<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
and which inflicts no violence on
the terms of the record. Viewed in this light, the phenomena
recorded in the Bible, in connection with geological
probabilities, lead us to infer that the physical agencies evoked
by the divine power to destroy this ungodly race were a
subsidence of the region they inhabited, so as to admit the
oceanic waters, and extensive atmospherical disturbances
connected with that subsidence, and perhaps with the elevation of
neighboring regions. In this case it is possible that the Caspian
Sea, which is now more than eighty feet below the level of the
ocean,
<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
and which was probably much more extensive then than
at present, received much of the drainage of the flood, and that
the mud and sand deposits of this sea and the adjoining desert
plains, once manifestly a part of its bottom, conceal any remains
that exist of the antediluvian population. In connection with
this, it may be remarked that, in the book of Job, Eliphaz speaks
as if the locality of those wicked nations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
which existed before the deluge was known and accessible in his time:</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:20%;">"Hast thou marked the ancient way<br />
Which wicked men have trodden,<br />
Who were seized [by the waters] in a moment,<br />
And whose foundations a flood swept away?"<br />
<span style="margin-left:15em;">&mdash;Job xxii., 15.</span></p>

<p>On comparing this statement with the answer of Job in the 26th
chapter, verse 5th, it would seem that the ungodly antediluvians
were supposed to be still under the waters; a belief quite
intelligible if the Caspian, which, on the latest and most
probable views of the locality of the events of this book, was
not very remote from the residence of Job,
<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
was supposed to mark the position of the pre-Noachic population, as the Dead Sea
afterward did that of the cities of the plain. Some of the dates
assigned to the book of Job would, however, render it possible
that this last catastrophe is that to which <i>he</i> refers:</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:20%;">"The <i>Rephaim</i> tremble from beneath<br />
The waters and their inhabitants.<br />
Sheol is naked before him,<br />
And destruction hath no covering."</p>

<p>The word <i>Rephaim</i> here has been variously rendered "shades of
the dead" and "giants." It is properly the family or national
name of certain tribes of gigantic Hamite men (the Anakim, Emim,
etc.) inhabiting Western Asia at a very remote period; and it
must here refer either to them or to the still earlier
antediluvian giants.
<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
It is also an important point to be noticed here that the
narrative of the deluge in Genesis is given as the testimony or
record of an eye-witness, and is to be so understood; and that
the terms of the record imply, not as usually held that all sorts
of animals were taken into Noah's ark, but only a selection, the
character of which is clearly indicated by a comparison of the
five lists of animals given in the narrative. Bearing this in
mind, and noticing that the writer tells of his own experience as
to the rise of the water, the drifting of the ark, the
disappearance of all visible shore, and the sounding fifteen
cubits where a hill had before been, all the difficulties of the
narrative of the deluge will at once disappear. These
difficulties have in fact arisen from regarding the story as the
composition of a historian, not as what it manifestly is, the log
or journal of a contemporary, introduced with probably little
change by the compiler of the book.</p>

<p>After the deluge, we find the human race settled in the plains of
the Euphrates and Tigris, attracted thither by the fertility of
their alluvial soils. There we find them engaging in a great
political scheme, no doubt founded on recollections of the old
antediluvian nationalities, and on a dread of the evils which
able and aspiring men would anticipate from that wide dispersion
of the human race that appears to have been intended by the
Creator in the new circumstances of the earth. They commenced
accordingly the erection of a city or tower at Babel, in the
plain of Shinar, to form a common bond of union, a great public
work that should be a rallying-point for the race, and around
which its patriotism might concentrate itself. The attempt was
counteracted by an interposition of divine Providence; and
thenceforth the diffusion of the human race proceeded unchecked,
carrying with it everywhere the memory of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
celebrated tower, which perpetuated itself not only in the mounds of Assyria and
Babylon and the pyramids of Egypt, but in the teocallis and
temple mounds of the New World. The Babel enterprise is in fact
the first recorded development of that mound-building instinct
which the earlier races everywhere evince, and which has been a
distinguishing characteristic more especially of the Cushite or
Turanian race, and has apparently made them the teachers of
constructive arts to all other peoples. Perhaps a dread of the
total decay and loss of the surviving antediluvian arts in
construction and other matters may have been one impelling motive
to the building of Babel. Perhaps it was connected with the
communistic ideas of the Turanian race, and their conflict with
the patriarchal habits of the Semites. Out of the enterprise at
Babel, however, arose a new type of evil, which, in the forms of
military despotism, the spirit of conquest, hero-worship, and the
alliance of these influences with literature and the arts, has
been handed down through every succeeding age to our own time.
The name of Nimrod, the son of Cush, has been preserved to us in
the Bible, and also apparently in the tablets and inscriptions of
Assyria, as the founder of the first despotism. This bold and
ambitious man, subsequently deified under different names,
established a Hamite or Turanian empire, which appears to have
extended its sway over the tribes occupying Southwestern Asia and
Northeastern Africa, everywhere supporting its power by force of
arms, and introducing a debasing polytheistic hero-worship, and
certain forms of art probably derived from antediluvian times.
The centre of this Cushite empire, however, gave way to the
rising power of Assyria or the Ashurite branch of the sons of
Shem, at a period antecedent to the dawn of profane history,
except in its mythical form; and when the light of secular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
history first breaks upon us, we find Egypt standing forth as the
only stable representative of the arts, the systems, and the
superstitions of the old Cushite empire, of which it had been the
southern branch; while other remnants of the Hamite races,
included in the empire of Nimrod, were scattered over Western
Asia, and, migrating into Europe, with or after the ruder but
less demoralized sons of Japheth, carried with them their
characteristic civilization and mythology, to take root in new
forms in Greece and Italy.
<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
Meanwhile the Assyrian and Persian (Elamite) races were growing in Middle Asia, and probably
driving the more eastern remnants of the Nimrodic empire into
India, borrowing at the same time their superstitions and their
claims to universal dominion. These views, which I believe to
correspond with the few notices in the Bible and in ancient
history, and to be daily receiving new confirmations from the
investigations of the ancient Assyrian monuments, enable us to
understand many mysterious problems in the early history of man.
They give us reason to suspect that the <i>principle</i> of the first
empire was an imitation of the antediluvian world, and that its
arts and customs were mainly derived from that source. They show
how it happens that Egypt, a country so far removed from the
starting-point of man after the deluge, should appear to be the
cradle of the arts, and they account for the Hamite and perhaps
antediluvian elements, mixed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
with primeval Biblical ideas, as
the cherubim, etc., in the old heathenism of India, Assyria, and
Southern Europe, and which they share with Egypt, having derived
them from the same source. They also show how it is that in the
most remote antiquity we find two well-developed and opposite
religious systems; the pure theism of Noah, and those who
retained his faith, and the idolatry of those tribes which
regarded with adoring veneration the objects and stages of the
creative work, the grander powers and objects of nature, the
mighty Cainites of the world before the flood, and the
postdiluvian leaders who followed them in their violence, their
cultivation of the arts, and their rebellion against God. These
heroes were identified with imaginative conceptions of the
heavenly bodies, animals, and other natural objects, associated
with the fortunes of cities and nations, with particular
territories, and with war and the useful arts, transmitted under
different names to one country after another, and localized in
each; and it is only in comparatively modern times that we have
been able to recognize the full certainty of the view held long
since by many ingenious writers, that among the greater gods of
Egypt and Assyria, and of consequence among those also of Greece
and Rome, were Nimrod, Ham, Ashur, Noah, Mizraim, and other
worthies and tyrants of the old world; and to suspect that
Tubalcain and Naamah, and other antediluvian names, were
similarly honored, though subsequently overshadowed by more
recent divinities. The later Assyrian readings of Rawlinson,
Hincks, and the lamented George Smith, and the more recent works
on Egyptian antiquities, are full of pregnant hints on these
subjects. It would, however, lead us too far from our immediate
subject to enter more fully into these questions. I have referred
to them merely to point out connecting-links
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
between the secular and sacred history of the earlier part of the human period, as a
useful sequel to our comparison of the latter with the
conclusions of science, and as furnishing hints which may guide
the geologist in connecting the human with the tertiary period,
and in distinguishing between the antediluvian and postdiluvian
portions of the former.</p>

<p>It may be said, however, that all this Biblical history, however
it may accord with the little that remains to us of the written
annals of early Oriental nations, is entirely at variance with
those modern arch&aelig;ological discussions which point to an immense
antiquity of the human race, and to a primitive barbarism out of
which all human culture was little by little evolved; and which
results of arch&aelig;ological investigation, while contradictory to
the Hebrew Scriptures, are entirely in accord with the
evolutionist philosophy. The prominence now given to such views
as these renders it necessary that we should denote a special
chapter to their discussion.</p>

<span style="font-size:70%;">UNITY AND ANTIQUITY OF MAN.</span><br /></h2>

<p style="font-size:80%;text-align:left;text-indent:3em;font-weight:bold;">"These are
the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their
nations: and by these were the nationsdivided in the earth after
the flood."&mdash;Genesis x., 32.</p>


<p>The theologians and evangelical Christians of our time, and with
them the credibility of the Holy Scriptures, are supposed by many
to have been impaled on a zoological and arch&aelig;ological dilemma,
in a manner which renders nugatory all attempts to reconcile the
Mosaic cosmogony with science. The Bible, as we have seen, knows
but one Adam, and that Adam not a myth or an ethnic name, but a
veritable man; but some naturalists and ethnologists think that
they have found decisive evidence that man is not of one but of
several origins. The religious tendency of this doctrine no
Christian can fail to perceive. In whatever way put, or under
whatever disguise, it renders the Bible history worthless,
reduces us to that isolation of race from race cultivated in
ancient times by the various local idolatries, and destroys the
brotherhood of man and the universality of that Christian
atonement which proclaims that "as in Adam all die, so in Christ
shall all be made alive."</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the greater weight of biological and
arch&aelig;ological evidence is here on the side of the Bible, and
philology comes in with strong corroborative proof. But just as
the orthodox theologian is beginning to congratulate himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
on the aid he has thus received, some of his new friends gravely
tell him that, in order to maintain their view, it is necessary
to believe that man has resided on earth for countless ages, and
that it is quite a mistake to suppose that his starting-point is
so recent as the Mosaic deluge. Nay, some very rampant theorists
of some ethnological schools try to pierce Moses and his abettors
with both horns of the dilemma at once, maintaining that men may
be of different species, and yet may have existed for an enormous
length of time as well. The recent prevalence of theories of
evolution has, however, thrown quite into the background the
discussions formerly active respecting the unity of man, but has,
along with geological and arch&aelig;ological discovery, given
increased prominence to those relating to the date of the origin
of our species and the manner of its introduction.</p>

<p>The Bible gives us a definite epoch, that of the deluge, about
2000 to 3000 B.C., for all existing races of men; but this,
according to it, was only the second starting-point of humanity,
and though no family but that of Noah survived the terrible
catastrophe, it would be a great error to suppose that nothing
antediluvian appears in the subsequent history of man. Before the
deluge there were arts and an old civilization, extending over at
least two thousand years, and after the deluge men carried with
them these heirlooms of the old world to commence with them new
nations. This has been tacitly ignored by many of the writers who
underrate the value of the Hebrew history. It may be as well for
this reason to place, in a series of propositions, the principal
points in Genesis which relate to the questions now before us.</p>

<p>1. Adam and Isha, the woman, afterward called Eve (Life-giver),
in consequence of the promise of a Redeemer, commenced a life of
husbandry on their expulsion from Eden,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
which, on the ordinary views of the Bible chronology, may be supposed to have occurred
from 4000 to 5000 years before the Christian era; and during the
lifetime of the primal pair, the sheep, at least, was
domesticated. The Bible, of course, knows nothing of the
imaginary continent of Lemuria, in which, according to some
hypotheses, men are supposed to have had their birth from apes. A
few generations after, in the time of Lamech, cattle were
domesticated; and the metals copper and iron were applied to
use&mdash;the latter probably meteoric iron; and hence, it may be, the
Hindoo and Hellenic myths of Twachtrei and Heph&aelig;stos in
connection with the thunderbolt. We learn, however, incidentally,
as already mentioned, in the description of Eden in Genesis,
chapter 2d, that there was a previous stone age, in which "flint,
pearls or shell beads, and stream-gold" were the chief treasures
of man, for this is implied in the "gold, bedolach, and onyx" of
the land of Havilah. It is certain also, from the discoveries
made in Assyria, on the site of Troy, and elsewhere, that the use
of stone implements continued in Western Asia long after the
deluge. In the time of Noah the distinction of clean and unclean
beasts, and the taking of seven pairs of certain beasts and birds
into the ark, imply that certain mammals and birds were
domesticated.
<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>2. Before the flood, as already remarked, there was a division of
man into two nationalities or races; and there was a citizen, an
agricultural, a pastoral, and a nomadic population. Farther, the
remarkable progress in the arts implied in the building of such
structures as the Tower of Babel, and other temple and palace
mounds in Assyria, and of the pyramids
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of Egypt, within a few generations after the deluge, proves that a very advanced
material civilization and great skill in constructive arts had
been reached in antediluvian times.
<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>3. After the deluge, the arts of the antediluvians and their
citizen life were almost immediately revived in the plain of
Shinar; but the plans of the Babel leaders, like those of many
others who have attempted to force distinct tribes into one
nationality, failed. The guilt attributed to them probably
relates to the attempt to break up the patriarchal and tribal
organization, which in these early times was the outward form of
true religion, in favor of some sort of national organization,
not compatible with the extension of man immediately over the
world, and tending to consolidation into dense communities. It
may be a question here whether the tribal communism which has
prevailed among the American Indians and other rude races was the
primitive form of society which the Babel-builders essayed to
change, or whether the Semitic patriarchal system had at first
prevailed, and the Babel difficulties were connected with a
conflict between this and communism or despotism, both new
Turanian or Aryan introductions. In any case, Babel, and Babylon
its successor, remain in the subsequent Biblical literature as
types of the God-defying and antichristian systems that have
succeeded each other from the time of Nimrod to this day.</p>

<p>4. The human race was scattered over the earth in family groups
or tribes, each headed by a leading patriarch, who gave it its
name. First, the three sons of Noah formed three main stems, and
from these diverged several family branches. The ethnological
chart in the 10th chapter of Genesis gives the principal branches
under patriarchal and ethnic names
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
but these, of course, continued to subdivide beyond the space and time referred to by
the sacred writer. It is simply absurd to object, as some writers
have done, to the universality of the statements in Genesis, that
they do not mention in detail the whole earth. They refer to a
few generations only, and beyond this restrict themselves to the
one branch of the human family to which the Bible principally
relates. We should be thankful for so much of the leading lines
of ethnological divergence, without complaining that it is not
followed out into its minute ramifications and into all history.</p>

<p>5. The tripartite division in Genesis x. indicates a somewhat
strict geographical separation of the three main trunks. The
regions marked out for Japheth include Europe and Northwestern
Asia. The name Japheth, as well as the statements in the table,
indicate a versatile, nomadic, and colonizing disposition as
characteristic of these tribes.
<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
The Median population, the
same with a portion of that now often called Aryan,
<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
was the only branch remaining near the original seats of the species, and
in a settled condition. The outlying portions of the posterity of
Japheth, on account of their wide dispersion, must at a very
early period have fallen into comparative barbarism,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
such as we find in historic periods all over Western and Northern Europe and
Northern Asia. Owing to their habitat, the Japhetites of the
Bible include none of the black races, unless certain Indian and
Australian nations are outlying portions of this family. The
Shemite nations showed little tendency to migrate, being grouped
about the Euphrates and Tigris valleys and neighboring regions.
For this reason, with the exception of certain Arab tribes, they
present no instances of barbarism, and generally retained a high
cerebral organization, and respectable though stationary
civilization, and they possess the oldest alphabet and
literature. The posterity of Ham differs remarkably from the
others. It spread itself over Southern, Central, and Eastern
Asia, Southern Europe, and Northern Africa, and constitutes the
stock alike of the Turanian and African races, as well as
probably of the American tribes. It has all along displayed a
great capacity for certain forms of art and semi-civilization,
but has rarely risen to the level of the Shemite and Japhetite
races. It established the earliest military and monarchical
institutions, and presents at the dawn of history&mdash;in Assyria, in
Egypt, and India&mdash;settled and arbitrary forms in politics and
religion, of a character so much resembling that of an old and
corrupt civilization that we can scarcely avoid supposing that
Ham and his family had preserved more than any of the other
Noachian races the arts and institutions of the old world before
the flood. It certainly presents itself in early postdiluvian
times as the first representative and teacher of art and material
civilization. The Hamite race is remarkable for the early
development of pantheism and hero-worship, and for the artificial
character of its culture. It presents us with the darkest colors,
and in the vast solitudes of Africa and Central Asia its outlying
tribes must have fallen into comparative
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
barbarism a few centuries after the deluge. It is farther to be observed that,
according to the Bible, the Canaanites and other Hamite nations
spoke languages not essentially different from those of the
Shemites, while the Japhetite nations were to them barbarians&mdash;"a
nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand." There was, too,
at the date of the dispersion of Babel, already a distinction of
tongues within each of the great races of men.</p>

<p>6. All the divisions of the family of Noah had from the first the
domesticated animals and the principal arts of life, and enjoyed
these in a national capacity so soon as sufficiently numerous.
The more scattered tribes, wandering into fresh regions, and
adopting the life of hunters, lost the characteristics of
civilization, and diverged widely from the primitive languages.
We should thus have, according to the Hebrew ethnology, a central
area presenting the principal stems of all the three races in a
permanently civilized state. All around this area should lie
aberrant and often barbarous tribes, differing most widely from
the original type in the more distant regions, and in those least
favorable to human health and subsistence. In these outlying
regions, secondary centres of civilization might grow up,
differing from that of the primitive centre, except in so far as
the common principles of human nature and intercommunication
might prevent this. All these conclusions, fairly deducible at
once from the Mosaic ethnology and the theory of dispersion from
a centre, are perfectly in accordance with observed facts, though
in absolute contradiction to prevalent ethnological conclusions,
based on these facts in connection with theories of development.</p>

<p>A multitude of Bible notices might easily be quoted illustrative
of these points, and also of the consistency of the Mosaic
narrative with itself. One of them may suffice here.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Abraham, who is said by the Jews to have been contemporary with Shem, as
Menes by the Egyptians with Ham, at least lived sufficiently near
to the time of the rise of the earliest nations to be taken as an
illustration of this primitive condition of society. He was not a
patriarch of the first or second rank, like Ham or Mizraim or
Canaan, but a subordinate family leader several removes from the
survivors of the deluge. Yet his tribe increases in comparatively
few years to a considerable number. He is treated as an equal by
the monarchs of Egypt and Philistia. He defeats, with a band of
three or four hundred retainers, a confederacy of four Euphratean
kings representing the embryo state of the Persian and Assyrian
empires, and already relatively so strong that they have overrun
much of Western Asia. All this bespeaks in a most consistent
manner the rapid rise of many small nationalities, scattered over
the better parts of wide regions, and still in a feeble
condition, though inheriting from their ancestors an old
civilization, and laying the foundations of powerful states. If
we attach any historical value whatever to the narrative, it
obviously implies that at a date of about two thousand years
before Christ the regions afterward occupied by the oldest
historic empires were still thinly peopled, and their dominant
races little more than feeble tribes. This farther corresponds
with the authentic history of all the ancient nations, however
these may have been extended by previous mythical periods. About
or shortly before the time of Abraham, Menes was draining for the
first time the swamps of Egypt, Ninus or Nimrod was founding the
Assyrian empire, the Phoenicians were founding Sidon,
agriculture was being introduced into China, the Vedas were being
written in India, the Persian monarchy was being founded; and, in
short, all the historical nations of the East
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
were originating, and this apparently by springing into being with an already
formed civilization.</p>

<p>Such being the Hebrew account of the date and early history of
man, it may be proper here to compare it with such deductions
from arch&aelig;ological and geological investigation as may seem to
conflict with it, and at the same time to make some comparisons
with the Turanian and Aryan traditions and speculations as to
human origins. The special lines of investigation important here
are: 1. Early historical records other than the Bible; 2. The
diversity of human languages; 3. The geological evidence afforded
by remains of prehistoric men found in caverns and other
repositories. The last of these is at present that which has
attained the greatest development.</p>

<p>1. <i>Early Human History.</i>&mdash;Had the human race everywhere
preserved historical records, we should have had some certain
evidence as to the places and times of origination of its tribes
and peoples. Unfortunately this has not been the case. All savage
and barbarous races, and many of those now civilized, have lost
all records of their early history. Most of the so-called ancient
nations are comparatively modern, and their history after a very
short course loses itself in uncertain tradition and mythical
fancies. The only really ancient nations that have given us in
detail their own written history are the Hebrews, the Assyrians,
the Egyptians, the Hindoos, and the Chinese. The last people,
though professedly very ancient, trace their history from a
period of barbarism&mdash;a view confirmed by their physical
characters and the nature of their civilization; and on this
account, if no other, their history can not be considered as of
much arch&aelig;ological value. According to their own records, their
earliest authentic history goes back to about 2800 B.C., and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
was preceded by a prehistoric period of uncertain duration. The
astronomical deductions of Schlegel, which would extend their
history to 17,000 years, are evidently altogether
unreliable.
<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
The early Hindoo history is palpably fabulous or
distorted, and has been variously modified and changed in
comparatively modern times. There is one great and very ancient
people&mdash;the Egyptian&mdash;evidently civilized from the beginning of
all history, that have succeeded in transmitting to us, though
only in fragments, their primeval history; and of late years
constant additions have been made from inscribed tablets and
monuments to our knowledge of the ancient history of the
Assyrians and Chaldeans.</p>

<p>The Egyptian history has been gathered first from sketches by
Greek travellers, and from fragments of the chronicles of
Manetho, one of the later Egyptian priests; and, secondly, from
the inscriptions deciphered on Egyptian monuments and papyri. It
is still in a very fragmentary and uncertain state, but has been
used with considerable effect to prove both the diversity of
races of men and the pre-Noachic antiquity of the species. The
Egyptian, in features and physical conformation, tended to the
European form, just as the modern Fellahs and Berbers do; but he
had a dark complexion, a somewhat elongated head and flattened
lips, and certain negroid peculiarities in his limbs. His
language combined many of the peculiarities of the Semitic,
Aryan, and African tongues, indicating thereby great antiquity or
else great intermixture, but not, as some ethnographers demand,
both; most probably the former&mdash;the Egyptians being really the
oldest civilized people that we certainly know, and therefore, if
languages have one origin, likely to be near its root-stock.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
The actual history of Egypt begins from Menes, the first human
king, a monarch, or rather tribal chief, who took up his abode in
the flats and fens of Lower Egypt, certainly not very long after
the deluge. His name has been translated "one who walks with
Khem," or Ham; one, therefore, who was contemporary with this
great patriarch and god of the Egyptians, which will place his
time within a few centuries of the Biblical flood. The date of
Menes has been variously placed. In correction of the ordinary
Hebrew chronology, we have the following attempts:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" border="1" summary="Egypt chronology">
<tr><td>Josephus places his reign</td><td>2350 B.C.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Hales' calculation</td><td>2412</td></tr>
<tr><td>Manetho and the Monuments, as corrected by Syncellus<br />
and calculated by various arch&aelig;ologists</td><td>2712<br />to<br />2782</td></tr>
<tr><td>Herodotus, astronomical reduction by Rennell</td><td>2890</td></tr>
<tr><td>Estimate by Gliddon in "Ancient Egypt"</td><td>2750</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bunsen, "Egypt's Place," etc.</td><td>4000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The truth may be somewhere near the mean of the shorter
chronologies given in the list.
<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
That of Bunsen is liable to
very grave objections; more especially as he adds to it other
views, altogether unsupported by historical evidence, which would
carry back the deluge to 10,000 years B.C. It rests wholly on the
chronology of Manetho, who lived 300 years B.C.; and who, even if
the Egyptians then possessed authentic documents extending 3700
years before his time, may have erred in his rendering of them;
and is farther liable to grave suspicions of having merely
grouped the names on the monuments of his country arbitrarily in
Sothic cycles. Farther,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
they rest on an interpretation of Manetho, which supposes his early dynasties to have been
successive, while good reasons have been found to prove that many
of them consist of contemporaneous petty sovereigns of parts of
Egypt. The early parts of Manetho's lists are purely mythical,
and it is impossible to fix the point where his authentic history
commences. He copied from monuments which have no consecutive
dates, the precise age of which could only be vaguely known even
in his time, and which are different in their statements in
different localities. It is only by making due allowance for
these uncertainties that any historical value can be attached to
these earlier dynasties of Manetho. Yet Bunsen has built on an
uncertain interpretation of this writer, as handed down in a very
fragmentary and evidently garbled condition, and on the equally
or more uncertain chronology of Eratosthenes, a system differing
from all previous belief on the subject, from the Hebrew history,
and from all former interpretations of the monuments and
Manetho.
<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Discarding, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
in the mean time, this date, and the still older one claimed by Mariette,
<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
we may roughly estimate the date of Menes as 2000 to 2500 years
B.C.,
<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
and proceed to state some of the facts developed by
Egyptologists.</p>

<p>One of the most striking of these is the proof that Egypt was a
new country in the days of Menes and several generations of his
successors. The monuments of this period show little of the
complicated idolatry, ritual, and caste system of later times,
and are deficient in evidence of the refinement and variety of
art afterward attained. They also show that these early monarchs
were principally engaged in dyking, and otherwise reclaiming the
alluvial flats; an evidence precisely of the same character with
that which every traveller sees in the more recently settled
districts of Canada, where the forest is giving way to the
exertions of the farmer. Farther, in this primitive period, known
as the "old monarchy," few domestic animals appear, and
experiments seem to have been in progress to tame others, natives
of the country, as the hyena, the antelope, the stork. Even the
dog in the older dynasties is represented by one or at most two
varieties, and the prevalent one is a wolfish-looking animal akin
to the present wild or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
half-tamed dogs of the East.
<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
The Egyptians, too, of the earlier dynasties, are more homogeneous in
their appearance than those of the later, after conquest and
migration had introduced new races; and the earliest monumental
notice referring to Negro tribes does not appear until the 12th
dynasty, about half-way between the epoch of Menes and the
Christian era, nor does any representation of the Negro features
occur until, at the earliest, the 17th dynasty. This allows ample
time&mdash;one thousand years at the least&mdash;for the development, under
abnormal circumstances and isolation, of all the most strongly
marked varieties of man. Still Egypt, even under the old
monarchy, presents evidence of the continuation of antediluvian
culture.
<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious, in short, that the whole aspect of early Egyptian
history presents to us a people already civilized taking
possession of that country at a period corresponding with that of
the subsidence of the Noachian deluge, and not finding there any
remains of older populations. Nor have any remains of such
populations been found by modern investigation.
<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>In Assyria the results of the recent discoveries, so well known
through many learned and popular works, strikingly confirm the
Hebrew chronology. They indicate no slow emergence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
from barbarism, but show that in Assyria as in Egypt implements of
stone and metal were used together by a primitive people, already
far advanced in civilization; and the oldest historical names
only carry us back to cities and sovereigns of the Abrahamic age,
while the story of the primitive empire of Nimrod and the
traditions of the deluge seem to have survived in more or less
mythical legends. The earliest Assyrian monuments would seem to
belong to a Turanian race, of which comparatively little is
known, but which may correspond with the primitive Cushites of
Biblical story. To these, it is true, Berosus attaches a fabulous
antiquity; but this is not confirmed by the monuments. These,
according to the latest facts disclosed by Smith, Rawlinson, and
others, appear to fix a date of about 1800 B.C. for the
foundation of the Assyrian monarchy proper, and the oldest
previous date given by Assurbampal, who reigned about B.C. 668 to
626, gives 1635 years before his time, or say 2280 B.C., as the
date of an Elamite king Kudarnankundi, who seems to be the leader
of a primitive tribe, one of the oldest in the region, and who
has been conjectured to have been the Chedorlaomer of Genesis,
but was probably one of his predecessors.</p>

<p>We gather from the Assyrian annals that the early Turanian kings,
while mound-builders like their kindred elsewhere, and acquainted
with metals and with the cuneiform writing, yet constituted
comparatively small nations, and were much occupied with hunting
and other rude sports, and with predatory expeditions, so as to
answer very nearly to the Biblical conception of the early
Cushite kingdom of the valley of the Euphrates, which was
probably in the same stage of culture with the nations that in a
later period inhabited the valley of the Mississippi, and are
known as the Alleghans.</p>

<p>In connection with the early history of man, much importance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
has been attached to the division of the early historic and
prehistoric ages into the periods of Stone, Bronze, and Iron, and
of the former into a Pal&aelig;olithic or ancient stone age, and a more
modern or Neolithic stone age. It is plain, however, that too
great importance has been attached to these distinctions, and
that they express rather differences of circumstances and of
culture than of age, so that they have really no bearing on the
Biblical chronology.</p>

<p>If pal&aelig;olithic or rudely chipped implements are the oldest known,
as they not improbably were the first tools used by man, yet
their use has extended in the case of rude nations all the way up
to the present time; and in America and Northern Asia we know
that their antiquity is but of yesterday, and that they were used
with highly finished implements of bone, and of those softer
stones that admit of being polished. No certain line can
therefore be drawn even locally between a Neolithic and a
Pal&aelig;olithic period, especially since in localities where flint
implements were extensively quarried and made, as on the banks of
rivers in Northern France and Southern England, and in such
places as "Grimes' Graves" and Cissbury in the latter country,
where mines were sunk in the chalk for the extraction of flints,
it necessarily happened that vast multitudes of unfinished or
spoiled implements and weapons were left on the ground, while the
better-formed specimens were for the most part taken away. This
conclusion is amply supported by similar localities in America,
where people well acquainted with many of the arts of life have
left quantities of strictly pal&aelig;olithic material. Wilson,
Southall, and other writers have accumulated so many examples of
this that I think the distinction of Pal&aelig;olithic and Neolithic
ages must now be given up by all investigators who possess
ordinary judgment. A remarkable instauce is the celebrated "Flint
ridge" of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Ohio, which was a great quarry of flint for implements
used by the ancient mound-builders, a highly civilized race, as
well as by the modern Indians. Here are found countless
multitudes of pal&aelig;olithic flint implements of all the ordinary
types, but which are merely the unfinished material of workers
capable of producing the most exquisite implements. There can be
scarcely a doubt that the pal&aelig;olithic implements of the European
gravels, in so far as they are the workmanship of man, are in
like manner merely the relics of old flint quarries.
<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Possibly a more accurate measurement of time for particular
regions of the world might be deduced from the introduction of
bronze and iron. If the former was, as many antiquarians suppose,
a local discovery in Europe, and not introduced from abroad, it
can give no measurement of time whatever. In America, as the
facts detailed by Dr. Wilson show, while a bronze age existed in
Peru, it was the copper age in the Mississippi Valley, and the
stone age elsewhere; and these conditions might have co-existed
for any length of time, and could give no indication of relative
dates. On the other hand, the iron introduced by European
commerce spread at once over the continent, and came into use in
the most remote tribes, and its introduction into America clearly
marks an historical epoch. With regard to bronze in Europe, we
must bear in mind that tin was to be procured only in England and
Spain, and in the latter in very small quantity; the mines of
Saxony do not seem to have been known till the Middle Ages. We
must further consider that tin ore is a substance not metallic in
appearance, and little likely to attract the attention of
savages; and that, as we gather from a hint of Pliny, it was
probably first observed, in the West at least, as stream tin, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the Spanish gold washings. Lastly, when we place in connection
with these considerations the fact that in the earliest times of
which we have certain knowledge, the tin trade of Spain and
England was monopolized by the Phoenicians, there seems to be a
strong probability that the extension of the trade of this nation
to the western Mediterranean really inaugurated the bronze
period. The only valid argument against this is the fact that
moulds and other indications of native bronze casting have been
found in Switzerland, Denmark, and elsewhere; but these show
nothing more than that the natives could recast bronze articles,
just as the American Indians can forge fish-hooks and knives out
of nails and iron hoops. Other considerations might be adduced in
proof of this view, but our limits will not permit us to refer to
them. The important questions still remain: When was this trade
commenced, and how rapidly did it extend itself from the
sea-coast across Europe? The British tin trade must have been in
existence in the time of Herodotus, though his notion of the
locality was not more definite than that it was in the extremity
of the earth. The Phoenician settlements in the western
Mediterranean must have existed as early as the time of Solomon,
when "ships of Tarshish" was the general designation of seagoing
ships for long voyages. How long previously these colonies
existed we do not know; but considering the great scarcity and
value of tin in those very ancient times, we may infer that
perhaps only the Spanish, and not the British deposits were known
thus early; or that the Phoenicians had only indirect access to
the latter. Perhaps we may fix the time when these traders were
able to supply the nations of Europe with abundance of bronze in
exchange for their products, at, say 1000 to 1200 B.C., as the
earliest probable period; and possibly from one to two centuries
would be a sufficient allowance for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
complete penetration of the trade throughout Europe. But of course wars or migrations
might retard or accelerate the process; and there may have been
isolated spots in which a partial stone period extended up to
those comparatively recent times in which first the Greek trade,
and afterward the entire overthrow of the Carthaginian power by
the Romans, terminated forever the age of bronze and substituted
the age of iron. This would leave, according to our ordinary
chronologies, at least ten or fifteen centuries for the
postdiluvian stone period in Europe and Western Asia, a time
quite sufficient in our view for all that part of it represented
by such monuments as the Danish shell-heaps or the platform
habitations of the Swiss lakes; leaving the remains of the
prehistoric caverns and river gravels for the antediluvian
period. A few facts in illustration of these points, and also of
the Biblical history, may be mentioned here.</p>

<p>We know perfectly that the early Chaldeans of the Euphratean
valley were acquainted with the use of metals&mdash;bronze certainly,
and at a very early date iron; yet flint knives and other
implements of stone are found under circumstances which show that
they were used in the palmy days of the Assyrian empire. The
inhabitants of Egypt were acquainted with bronze and iron long
before the date of the Exodus, yet the Egyptians used stone
knives for some purposes up to a comparatively modern time.
Joshua used stone knives for the purpose of circumcision; and
according to Herodotus there were Ethiopians in the army of
Xerxes who used stone-tipped arrows. If any antiquarian were to
stumble on the "hill of the foreskins"&mdash;a mound under which were
buried in all probability the multitudinous flint flakes used in
the circumcision of the thousands of Israel&mdash;or the grave in
which some of the Ethiopian auxiliaries of Xerxes were buried
with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
their flint arrow-heads and javelins of antelopes' horn,
how absurd would be the inference that these repositories were of
the pal&aelig;olithic age. Nay, so late as 1870 a traveller was
informed that the Bagos, a people of Abyssinia, still made and
used stone hatchets and flint knives.
<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In Europe we find reason to believe that the Ligurians of
Northwestern Italy were flint-folk of very rude type until they
were conquered by the Gauls about 400 B.C.
<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Though the Gauls, Britons, and Germans of the age of Julius C&aelig;sar had iron weapons,
yet it is evident that the metal was very scarce, and that bronze
was more common; and in confirmation of this it is found that in
the trenches before Alize, the Alesia of C&aelig;sar, where the final
struggle of the Roman general with Vercingetorix took place,
weapons of stone, bronze, and iron are intermixed. All over the
more northern parts of Europe there is the best reason to believe
that the use of stone and bronze continued to a much later
period, and locally until long after the Christian era. It is
clear that such facts as these must greatly modify our ideas of
the probable age of the Swiss lake villages, and should induce
the greatest caution in claiming any special antiquity for
particular classes of implements.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable discoveries of modern times is that of
the site of ancient Troy by Dr. Schliemann, and it affords clear
and decisive evidence as to the historic value of the ages to
which we have referred.</p>

<p>Troy was destroyed by the Greeks perhaps about 1300 B.C., and we
know from Homer that this was in what for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Greeks and Trojans may properly be termed the copper age, weapons and armor of that
metal being in common use, and also the mode of burial by
cremation. We may well suppose that at that early date the stone
age was still in full force in Northern Europe and Asia, and in
the mountains of Switzerland; and as the tin mines of England had
not yet been reached, bronze was scarce and dear even in Eastern
Europe and Asia. Now Schliemann has disinterred the undoubted
Trojan Ilium on the hill of Hissarlik; but he finds it to be only
one of several buried cities, and the succession of strata will
be most clearly seen in the section on the following page,
compiled from his clear and circumstantial descriptions. It is
needless to say that this presents a succession of the stone age
to one of comparatively high civilization. It also forms an
epitome of that of the whole East, and of primitive man in
general, in some very important respects. We have first, at a
date probably coeval with that of the earliest monarchies of
Assyria and Egypt, a primitive people whose arts and mode of life
remind us strongly of the American Toltecans and Peruvians.
<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Schliemann supposes them to have been Aryan, but they were more
probably of Turanian race. They must have occupied the site for a
very long time. They were succeeded by a more cultivated people
of fine physical organization, yet possibly still Turanians or
primitive Aryans, who by trade or plunder had accumulated large
stores of metallic wealth, and had made advances in the arts of
life placing them on a level with the early Phoenicians and
Egyptians, with whom they probably had intercourse. These

<p>were the Trojans of the Homeric poems, and the destruction of
their city was probably in the first instance celebrated in their
own native songs, which Homer at a date but little later
<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
wove into his magnificent poem, and idealized and exaggerated.
The Trojans worshipped an owl-headed goddess&mdash;the Athena
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
of the Homeric poems; and from symbols found are believed also to have
had the worship of a sacred tree, and of fire or of the Sun. All
of these are widespread superstitions over both the Old and New
World. But while Troy flourished there were barbarous nations not
far off still in the stone age; and when the city had fallen,
these, possibly in successive hordes, took possession of the
fertile plain and used the old city as their stronghold, perhaps
till the foundation of the Greek city about 650 B.C. I have
sketched in some detail these interesting discoveries, as they so
clearly illustrate an actual succession of ages, and so
conclusively show the uncertainty of the classification into ages
of stone and metal, except when taken in connection with the
precise circumstances of each locality.</p>

<p>I have referred above only to the question of historic or
postdiluvian man. We have still to consider what remains exist of
antediluvian man. These may be studied in connection with our
third head of geological evidences of man's antiquity; for if the
Mosaic narrative be true, the diluvial catastrophe must have
constituted a physical separation between historic man and
prehistoric; since, in so far as antediluvian ages are concerned,
all are prehistoric or mythical everywhere except in the sacred
history itself. Antediluvian men may thus in geology be
Pleistocene as distinguished from modern, or Pal&aelig;ocosmic as
distinguished from Neocosmic.

<p>2. <i>Language in Relation to the Antiquity of Man.</i>&mdash;In many
animals the voice has a distinctive character; but in man it has
an importance altogether peculiar. The gift of speech is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
one of his sole prerogatives, and identity in its mode of exercise is
not only the strongest proof of similarity of psychical
constitution, but more than any other character marks identity of
origin. The tongues of men are many and various; and at first
sight this diversity may, as indeed it often does, convey the
impression of radical diversity of race. But modern philological
investigations have shown many and unexpected links of connection
in vocabulary or grammatical structure, or both, between
languages apparently the most dissimilar. I do not here refer to
the vague and fanciful parallels with which our ancestors were
often amused, but to the results of sober and scientific inquiry.
"Nothing," says Professor Max M&uuml;ller, "necessitates the admission
of different independent beginnings for the material elements of
the Turanian, Semitic, and Aryan branches of speech; nay, it is
possible even now to point out radicals which, under various
changes and disguises, have been current in these three branches
ever since their first separation." Of the truth of this I have
convinced myself by some original investigation, and also of the
farther truth that of this radical unity of all human tongues
there is more full evidence than many philologists are disposed
to admit, and that the results of future study must be to connect
more and more with each other the several main stems of language.
Whether this results merely from the psychical unity of the human
race, or from the historical derivation of languages from one
root, is not so material as the fact of unity; but that the
latter is implied it would not be difficult to show.
<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
Let us examine for a little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
these results as they are presented to us
by Latham, M&uuml;ller, Bunsen, and other modern philologists.</p>

<p>A convenient starting-point is afforded by the great group of
languages known as the Indo-European, Japhetic, or Aryan. From
the Ganges to the west coast of Ireland, through Indian, Persian,
Greek, Italian, German, Celt, runs one great language&mdash;the
Sanscrit and the dark Hindoo at one extreme, the Erse and the
xanthous Celt at the other. No one now doubts the affinity of
this great belt of languages. No one can pretend that any one of
these nations learned its language from another. They are all
decided branches of a common stock. Lying in and near this area
are other nations&mdash;as the Arabs, the Syrians, the Jews&mdash;speaking
languages differing in words and structure&mdash;the Semitic tongues.
Do these mark a different origin? The philologists answer in the
negative, pointing to the features of resemblance which still
remain, and above all to certain intermediate tongues of so high
antiquity that they are rather to be regarded as root-stocks from
which other languages diverged than as mixtures. The principal of
these is the ancient Egyptian, represented by the inscriptions on
the monuments of that wonderful people, and by the more modern
Coptic, which, according to Bunsen and Latham, presents decided
affinities to both the great classes previously mentioned, and
may be regarded as strictly intermediate in its character. It has
accordingly been designated by the term Sub-Semitic.
<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
But it shares this character with all or nearly all the other African
languages, which bear strong marks of affinity to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Egyptian and Semitic tongues. On this subject Dr. Latham says, "That the
uniformity of languages throughout Africa is greater than it is
either in Asia or in Europe, is a statement to which I have not
the least hesitation in committing myself."
<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
To the north the Indo-European area is bounded by a great group of semi-barbarous
populations, mostly with Mongolian features, and speaking
languages which have been grouped as Turanian. These Turanian
languages, on the one hand, graduate without any break into those
of the Esquimaux and American Indians; on the other, according to
M&uuml;ller and Latham, they are united, though less distinctly, with
the Semitic and Japhetic tongues. They not improbably represent
in more or less altered forms the most primitive stock of
language from which both the Semitic and Japhetic groups have
branched. Another great area on the coasts and in the islands of
the Pacific is overspread by the Malay, which, through the
populations of Transgangetic India, connects itself with the
great Indo-European line. Mr. Edkins, in his remarkable book on
"China's Place in Philology," has collected a large amount of
fact tending to show that the early Chinese in its monosyllabic
radicals presents root-forms traceable into all the stocks of
human speech in the Old World; and the American languages would
have furnished him with similar lines of affinity. If we regard
physical characters, manners, and customs, and mythologies, as
well as mere language, it is much easier thus to link together
nearly all the populations of the globe. In investigations of
this kind, it is true, the links of connection are often delicate
and evanescent; yet they have conveyed to the ablest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
investigators the strong impression that the phenomena are rather
those of division of a radical language than of union of several
radically distinct.</p>

<p>This impression is farther strengthened when we regard several
results incidental to these researches. Latham has shown that the
languages of men may be regarded as arranged in lines of
divergence, the extreme points of which are Fuego, Tasmania,
Easter Island; and that from all these points they converge to a
common centre in Western Asia, where we find a cluster of the
most ancient and perfect languages; and even Haeckel is obliged
to adopt in his map of the affiliation of races of men a similar
scheme, though he, without any good historical or scientific
evidence, extends it back into the imaginary lost continent of
Lemuria. Farther, the languages of the various populations differ
in proceeding from these centres in a manner pointing to
degeneracy such as is likely to occur in small and rude tribes
separating from a parent stock. These lines of radiation follow
the most easy and probable lines of migration of the human race
spreading from one centre. It must also be observed that in the
primary migration of men, there must of necessity have been at
its extreme limits outlying and isolated tribes, placed in
circumstances in which language would very rapidly change;
especially as these tribes, migrating or driven forward, would be
continually arriving at new regions presenting new circumstances
and objects. When at length the utmost limit in any direction was
reached, the inroads of new races of population would press into
close contact these various tribes with their different dialects.
Where the distance was greatest before reaching this limit, we
might expect, as in America, to find the greatest mutual variety
and amount of difference from the original stock. After the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
primary migration had terminated, the displacements arising from
secondary migrations and conquests, would necessarily complicate
the matter by breaking up the original gradations of difference,
and thereby rendering lines of migration difficult to trace.</p>

<p>Taking all these points into the account, along with the known
tendencies of languages in all circumstances to vary, it is
really wonderful that philology is still able to give so decided
indications of unity.</p>

<p>There is, in the usual manner of speaking of these subjects, a
source of misapprehension, which deserves special mention in this
place. The Hebrew Scriptures derive all the nations of the
ancient world from three patriarchs, and the names of these have
often been attached to particular races of men and their
languages; but it should never be supposed that these
classifications are likely to agree with the Bible affiliation.
They may to a certain extent do so, but not necessarily or even
probably. In the nature of the case, those portions of these
families which remained near the original centre, and in a
civilized state, would retain the original language and features
comparatively unchanged. Those which wandered far, fell into
barbarism, or became subjected to extreme climatic influences,
would vary more in all respects. Hence any general
classification, whether on physical or philological characters,
will be likely to unite, as in the Caucasian group of Cuvier, men
of all the three primitive families, while it will separate the
outlying and aberrant portions from their main stems of
affiliation. Want of attention to this point has led to much
misconception; and perhaps it would be well to abandon altogether
terms founded on the names of the sons of Noah, except where
historical affiliation is the point in question. It would be well
if it were understood that when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
terms Semitic, Japhetic,
<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
and Hametic are used, direct reference is made to
the Hebrew ethnology; and that, where other arrangements are
adopted, other terms should be used. It is obviously unfair to
apply the terms of Moses in a different way from that in which he
uses them. A very prevalent error of this kind has been to apply
the term Japhetic to a number of nations not of such origin
according to the Bible; and another of more modern date is to
extend the term Semitic to all the races descended from Ham,
because of resemblance of language. It should be borne in mind
that, assuming the truth of the Scriptural affiliation, there
should be a "central" group of races and languages where the
whole of the three families meet, and "sporadic"
<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
groups representing the changes of the outlying and barbarous tribes.</p>

<p>While, however, all the more eminent philologists adhere to the
original unity of language, they are by no means agreed as to the
antiquity of man; and some, as for instance Latham and Dr. Max
M&uuml;ller, are disposed to claim an antiquity for our species far
beyond that usually admitted. In so far as this affects the Bible
history, it is important, inasmuch as this would appear to limit
the possible antiquity of all languages to the time of the
deluge. The date of this event has been variously estimated, on
Biblical grounds, at from 1650 B.C. (Usher) to 3155 B.C.
(Josephus and Hales); but the longest of these dates does not
appear to satisfy the demands of philology. The reason of this
demand is the supposed length
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
of time required to effect the
necessary changes. The subject is one on which definite data can
scarcely be obtained. Languages change now, even when reduced to
a comparatively stable form by writing. They change more rapidly
when men migrate into new climates, and are placed in contact
with new objects. The English, the Dutch, and the German were
perhaps all at the dawn of the medi&aelig;val era M&aelig;so-Gothic. At the
same rate of change, allowing for greater barbarism and greater
migrations, they may very well have been something not far from
Egyptian or Sanscrit 2000 years before Christ. The truth is that
present rates of variation afford no criterion for the changes
that must occur in the languages of small and isolated tribes
lapsing into or rising from barbarism, possessing few words, and
constantly requiring to name new objects and until some ratio
shall have been established between these conditions and those of
modern languages, fixed by literature and by a comparatively
stationary state of society, it is useless to make any demands
for longer time on this ground.
<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Even in the present day, Moffat informs us that in South Africa
the separation of parts of a tribe, for even a few months, may
produce a notable difference of dialect. If we take the existing
languages of civilized men whose history is known, we shall find
that it is impossible to trace many of them back as far as the
Christian era, and when we have passed over even half that
interval, they become so different as to be unintelligible to
those who now speak them. Where there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
are exceptions to this, they arise entirely from the effects of literature and artificial
culture. While, therefore, there is good ground in philology for
the belief in one primitive language, there seems no absolute
necessity to have recourse even to the confusion of tongues at
Babel to explain the diversities of language.
<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Farther, the Bible carries back the Semitic group of languages at least to the
time of the Deluge, but it does not seem necessary on the mere
ground of antediluvian names, to carry it any farther back, and
the Assyrian inscriptions show the coexistence of Turanian and
Semitic tongues at the dawn of history in the region of the
Euphrates and Tigris. One or other of these&mdash;or a monosyllabic
language underlying it&mdash;was probably an antediluvian tongue, and
the other a very early derivative; and both history and philology
would assign the precedence to the Turanian language, which was
probably most akin to that which had descended from antediluvian
times, and which at that early period of dispersion indicated in
the Bible story of Babel, had begun to throw off its two great
branches of the Aryan and Semitic languages. These, proceeding in
two dissimilar lines of development, continue to exist to this
day along with the surviving portions of the uncultivated
Turanian speech. To this point, however, we may return under
another head.</p>

<span style="font-size:70%;">UNITY AND ANTIQUITY OF MAN&mdash;(<i>Continued.</i>)</span><br /></h2>


<p style="font-size:80%;text-align:left;text-indent:3em;font-weight:bold;">
"By the word of God the heavens were from of old, and the
earth, formed out of water, and by means of water, by which
waters the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
perished."&mdash;2 Peter iii., 5, 6.</p>


<p>3. <i>Geological Evidence as to the Antiquity of Man.</i>&mdash;No
geological fact can now be more firmly established than the
ascending progression of animal life, whereby from the early
invertebrates of the Eozoic and Primordial series we pass upward
through the dynasties of fishes and reptiles and brute mammals to
the reign of man. In this great series man is obviously the last
term; and when we inquire at what point he was introduced, the
answer must be in the later part of the great Cainozoic or
Tertiary period, which is the latest of the whole. Not only have
we the negative fact of the absence of his remains from all the
earlier Tertiary formations, but the positive fact that all the
mammalia of these earlier ages are now extinct, and that man
could not have survived the changes of condition which destroyed
them and introduced the species now our contemporaries. This fact
is altogether independent of any question as to the introduction
of species by derivation or by creation. The oldest geological
period in which any animals nearly related in structure to man
occur is that named the Miocene, and no traces of man have as yet
been found in any deposits of this age. All human remains known
belong either to the Pleistocene or Modern.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Now the Pleistocene was characterized by one of those periods of glacial cold which
have swept over the earth&mdash;by one of those great winters which
have so chilled the continents that few forms of life could
survive them&mdash;and man comes in at the close of this cold period,
in what is called the Post-glacial age. Some geologists, it is
true, hold to an interglacial warm period, in which man is
supposed to have existed, but the evidence of this is extremely
slender and doubtful, and it carries back in any case human
antiquity but a very little way. I have, in my "Story of the
Earth and Man," shown reason for the belief, in which I find
Professor Hughes, of Cambridge, coincides with me,
<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
that the interglacial periods are merely an ingenious expedient to get rid
of the difficulties attending the hypothesis of the universal
glaciation of the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>But, though man is thus geologically modern, it is held that
historically his existence on earth may have been very ancient,
extending perhaps ten or twenty, or even a hundred times longer
than the period of six or seven thousand years supposed to be
proved by sacred history. Let us first, as plainly and simply as
possible, present the facts supposed thus to extend the antiquity
of man, and then inquire as to their validity and force as
arguments in this direction.</p>

<p>The arguments from geology in favor of a great antiquity for man
may be summarized thus: (1) Human remains are found in caverns
under very thick stalagmitic crusts, and in deposits of earth
which must have accumulated before these stalagmites began to
form, and when the caverns were differently situated with
reference to the local drainages. (2) Remains of man are found
under peat-bogs which have grown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
so little in modern times that their antiquity on the whole must be very great. (3) Implements,
presumably made by men, are found in river-gravels so high above
existing riverbeds that great physical changes must have occurred
since they were accumulated. (4) One case is on record where a
human bone is believed to have been found under a deposit of
glacial age. (5) Human remains have been found under
circumstances which indicate that very important changes of level
have taken place since their accumulation. (6) Human remains have
been found under circumstances which indicate great changes of
climate as intervening between their date and that of the modern
period. (7) Man is known to have existed, in Europe at least, at
the same time with some quadrupeds formerly supposed to have been
extinct before his introduction. (8) The implements, weapons,
etc., found in the oldest of these repositories are different
from those known to have been used in historic times.</p>

<p>These several heads include, I think, all the really material
evidence of a geological character. It is evidence of a kind not
easily reducible into definite dates, but there can be no doubt
that its nature, and the rapid accumulation of facts within a
small number of years, have created a deep and widespread
conviction among geologists and arch&aelig;ologists that we must
relegate the origin of man to a much more remote antiquity than
that sanctioned by history or by the Biblical chronology. I shall
first review the character of this evidence, and then state a
number of geological facts which bear in the other direction, and
have been somewhat lost sight of in recent discussions. Of the
facts above referred to, the most important are those which
relate to caverns, peat-bogs, and river-gravels. We may,
therefore, first consider the nature and amount of this
evidence.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
That the reader may more distinctly understand the geological
history of these more recent periods of the earth's history which
are supposed to have witnessed the advent of man, in Western
Europe at least, I quote the following summary from Sir Charles
Lyell of the more modern changes in that portion of the world.
These are:</p>

<p>"First, a continental period, toward the close of which the
forest of Cromer flourished; when the land was at least 500 feet
above its present level, perhaps much higher. * * * The remains
of <i>Hippopotamus major</i> and <i>Rhinoceros etruscus</i>, found in beds
of this period, seem to indicate a climate somewhat milder than
that now prevailing in Great Britain. [This was a <i>Preglacial</i>
era, and may be regarded as belonging to the close of the
Pliocene tertiary.]</p>

<p>"Secondly, a period of submergence, by which the land north of
the Thames and Bristol Channel, and that of Ireland, was
generally reduced to * * * an archipelago. * * * This was the
period of great submergence and of floating ice, when the
Scandinavian flora, which occupied the lower grounds during the
first continental period, may have obtained exclusive possession
of the only lands not covered with perpetual snow. [This
represents the Glacial period; but according to the more extreme
glacialists only a portion of that period.]</p>

<p>"Thirdly, a second continental period, when the bed of the
glacial sea, with its marine shells and erratic blocks, was laid
dry, and when the quantity of land equalled that of the first
period. * * * During this period there were glaciers in the
higher mountains of Scotland and Wales, and the Welsh glaciers *
* * pushed before them and cleared out the marine drift with
which some valleys had been filled during the period of
submergence. * * * During this last period
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the passage of the Germanic flora into the British area took place, and the
Scandinavian plants, together with northern insects, birds, and
quadrupeds, retreated into the higher grounds. * * *</p>

<p>"Fourthly, the next and last change comprised the breaking up of
the land of the British area once more into numerous islands,
ending in the present geographical condition of things. There
were probably many oscillations of level during this last
conversion of continuous land into islands, and such movements in
opposite directions would account for the occurrence of marine
shells at moderate heights above the level of the sea,
notwithstanding a general lowering of the land. * * * During this
period a gradual amelioration of temperature took place, from the
cold of the glacial period to the climate of historical
times."

<a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The second continental period above referred to is that which
appears on the best evidence to have been the time of the
introduction of man; but such facts as that of the Settle Cave,
and the implements of the breccia in Kent's Cave, if rightly
interpreted, would make man preglacial or "interglacial."</p>

<p>The deposits found in caverns in France, Switzerland, Germany,
Belgium, and England have afforded a large proportion of the
remains from which we derive our notions of the most ancient
prehistoric men of Europe. From the Belgian caves, as explored by
M. Dupont, we learn that there were two successive prehistoric
races, both rude or comparatively uncivilized. The first were men
of Turanian type, but of great bodily stature and high cerebral
organization, and showing remarkable skill in the manufacture of
implements
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
and ornaments of bone and ivory. These men are
believed to have been contemporary with the earlier postglacial
mammals, as the mammoth and hairy rhinoceros, and to have lived
at a time when the European land was more extensive than at
present, stretching far to the west of Ireland, and connecting
Great Britain with the Continent. The skeletons found at
Cro-Magnon, Mentone, and elsewhere in France fully confirm the
deductions of Dupont as to this earliest race of Pal&aelig;ocosmic,
Pal&aelig;olithic, or antediluvian man. This grand race seems to have
perished or been driven from Europe by the great depression of
the level of the land which inaugurated the modern era, and which
was probably accompanied by many oscillations of level as well as
by considerable changes of climate. They were succeeded by a
second race, equally Turanian in type, but of small stature, and
resembling the modern Lapps. These were the "allophylian" peoples
displaced by the historical Celts, and up to their time the
reindeer seems to have existed abundantly in France and Germany.
These two successive prehistoric populations have been termed
respectively men of the "mammoth" age and men of the "reindeer"
age. The Bible record would lead us to regard the earlier and
gigantic men as antediluvian, and the smaller or Lappish race as
postdiluvian. We may therefore, having already at some length
considered the postdiluvian age, take up the mode of occurrence
of the remains of the earlier of the two races&mdash;that of the
mammoth age.</p>

<p>The caverns themselves may be divided into those of residence, of
sepulture, and of driftage, though one cavern has often
successively assumed two at least of these characters. In the
caverns of residence large accumulations have been formed of
ashes, charcoal, bones, and other d&eacute;bris of cookery, among which
are found flint and bone implements, the general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
character of which, as well as that of the needles, stone hammers, mortars for
paint, and other domestic appliances, are not more dissimilar
from those of the Red Indian and Esquimau races in North America
than these are from one another, and in many things, as in the
bone harpoons, the resemblance is very striking indeed. In
tendency to imitative art, and in the skill of their delineations
of animals, the prehistoric men seem to have surpassed all the
American races except the semi-civilized mound-builders and the
more cultivated Mexican and Peruvian nations. With regard to the
residence of these men of the mammoth age in caverns, several
things are indicated by American analogies to which some
attention should be paid.</p>

<p>It is not likely that caverns were the usual places of residence
of the whole population. They may have been winter houses for
small tribes and detached families of fugitives or outlaws, or
they may have been places of resort for hunting parties at
certain seasons of the year. The large quantities of broken and
uncooked bones of particular species, as of the horse and
reindeer, in some of the caverns, would farther indicate a habit
of making great battues, like those of the American hunting
tribes, at certain seasons, and of preparing quantities of
pemmican or dried meat preserved with marrow and fat for future
use. The number of bone needles found in some of the caves would
seem to hint that, like the Americans, they sewed up their
pemmican in skin bags. The multitude of flint flakes and of rude
stone implements applicable to breaking bones certainly indicates
a wholesale cutting of flesh and preparation of marrow. In the
"Story of the Earth," I have suggested in connection with this
that there may have been towns or villages of these people
unknown to us, and which would afford higher conceptions of
their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
progress in the arts. This anticipation appears recently
to have been realized in the discovery of such a town or
fortified village of the mammoth age at Soloutre, in France, and
which seems to afford evidence that these ancient people had
already domesticated the horse, using it as food as well as a
beast of burden, in the manner of the Khirgis and certain other
Tartar tribes of Central Asia.
<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
This, with the undoubtedly high cerebral organization indicated by the skulls of the mammoth
age, notably raises our estimate of the position of man at this
early date.</p>

<p>With regard to caves of sepulture, the same remark may be made as
with regard to the caves of residence. They do not seem to have
been the burial-places of large populations, but only occasional
places of interment, few bodies being found in them, and these
often interred in the midst of culinary d&eacute;bris, evidencing
previous or contemporary residence. With regard to the latter, it
seems to have been no uncommon practice with some North American
tribes to bury the dead either in the floors of their huts or in
their immediate proximity. It is probable, however, that the few
examples known of caves of sepulture of this period indicate not
tribal or national places of burial, but occasional and
accidental cases, happening to hunting or war parties, perhaps
remote from their ordinary places of residence. In so far as
method of burial is concerned, the men of the Pal&aelig;ocosmic or
Mammoth age seem to have buried the dead extended at full length,
and not in the crouching posture usual with some later races.
Like the Americans, they painted the dead man, and buried him
with his robes and ornaments, and probably with his weapons, thus
intimating their belief in happy hunting-grounds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
beyond the grave.
<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
I may remark here that all the known interments of
the mammoth age indicate a race of men of great cerebral
capacity, with long heads and coarsely marked features, of large
stature and muscular vigor, surpassing indeed much in all these
respects the average man of modern Europe. These characteristics
befit men who had to contend with the mammoth and his
contemporaries, and to subdue the then vast wildernesses of the
eastern continent, and they correspond with the Biblical
characteristics of antediluvian man.</p>

<p>Among caves of driftage may be classed some of those near Li&egrave;ge,
in Belgium, and, partially at least, those of Kent's Hole and
Brixham, in England. In these only disarticulated remnants of
human skeletons, or more frequently only flint implements, some
of them of doubtful character, have been found. In my "Story of
the Earth," I have taken the carefully explored Kent's Cavern of
Torquay as a typical example, and have condensed its phenomena as
described by Mr. Pengelly. I now repeat this description, with
some important emendations suggested by that gentleman in more
recent reports and in private correspondence.</p>

<p>The somewhat extensive and ramifying cavern of Kent's Hole is an
irregular excavation, evidently due partly to fissures or joints
in limestone rock, and partly to the erosive action of water
enlarging such fissures into chambers and galleries. At what time
it was originally cut we do not know, but it must have existed as
a cavern at the close of the Pliocene or beginning of the
Post-pliocene period, since which time it has been receiving a
series of deposits which have quite filled up some of its smaller
branches.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
First and lowest, according to Mr. Pengelly, of the deposits as
yet known, is a "breccia," or mass of broken and rounded stones,
with hardened red clay filling the interstices. Some of the
stones are of the rock which forms the roof and walls of the
cave, but the greater number, especially the rounded ones, are
from more distant parts of the surrounding country. Many are
fragments of grit from the Devonian beds of adjacent hills. There
are also fragments of stalagmite from an old crust broken up when
the breccia was deposited, and possibly belonging to Pliocene
times. In this mass, the depth of which is unknown, are numerous
bones, nearly all of one kind of animal, the cave bear or bears,
for there may be more than one species&mdash;creatures which seem to
have lived in Western Europe from the close of the Pliocene down
to the modern period. They must have been among the earliest and
most permanent tenants of Kent's Hole at a time when its lower
chambers were still filled with water. Teeth of a lion and of the
common fox also occur in this deposit, but rarely. Next above the
breccia is a floor of "stalagmite," or stony carbonate of lime,
deposited from the drippings of the roof, and in some places more
than twelve feet thick. This also contains bones of the cave
bear, deposited when there was less access of water to the
cavern. Mr. Pengelly infers the existence of man at this time
from the occurrence of chipped flints supposed to be artificial;
but which, in so far as I can judge from the specimens described
and figured, must still be regarded as of doubtful origin.</p>

<p>After the old stalagmite floor above mentioned was formed, the
cave again received deposits of muddy water and stones; but now a
change occurs in the remains embedded. This stony clay, or "cave
earth," has yielded an immense quantity of teeth and bones,
including those of the elephant, rhinoceros,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
horse, hyena, cave bear, reindeer, and Irish elk. With these were found weapons of
chipped flint, and harpoons, needles, and bodkins of bone,
precisely similar to those of the North American Indians and
other rude races. The "cave earth" is four feet or more in
thickness. It is not stratified, and contains many fallen
fragments of rock, rounded stones, and broken pieces of
stalagmite. It also has patches of the excrement of hyenas, which
the explorers suppose to indicate the temporary residence of
these animals; and besides fragments of charcoal scattered in the
mass, there is in one spot, near the top, a limited layer of
burned wood, with remains which indicate the cooking and eating
of repasts of animal food by man. It is clear that when this bed
was formed the cavern was liable to be inundated with muddy
water, carrying stones and perhaps some of the bones and
implements, and breaking up in places the old stalagmite
floor.
<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
One of the most puzzling features, especially to
those who take an exclusively uniformitarian view, is that the
entrance of water-borne mud and stones implies a level of the
bottom of the water in the neighboring valleys of nearly one
hundred feet above its present height. The cave earth is covered
by a second crust of stalagmite, less dense and thick than that
below, and containing only a few bones, which are of the same
general character with those beneath, but include a fragment of a
human jaw with teeth. Evidently when this stalagmite was formed
the influx of water-borne materials had ceased, or nearly so; and
Mr. Pengelly appears to affirm, though without assigning any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
reason, that none of these bones could, like the masses of
stalagmite, have been lifted from lower beds, or washed into the
cave from without.</p>

<p>The next bed marks a new change. It is a layer of black mould
from three to ten inches thick. Its microscopic structure does
not seem to have been examined; but it is probably a forest soil,
introduced by growth, by water, by wind, and by ingress of
animals, all of them modern, and contains works of art from the
old British times before the Roman invasion up to the porter
bottles and dropped half-pence of modern visitors. Lastly, in and
upon the black mould are many fallen blocks from the roof of the
cave.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that this cave and the neighboring one of
Brixham have done very much to impress the minds of British
geologists with ideas of the great antiquity of man; and they
have, more than any other postglacial monuments, shown the
existence of some animals now extinct up to the human age. Of
precise data for determining time, they have, however, given
nothing. The only measures which seem to have been applied,
namely, the rate of growth of stalagmite and the rate of erosion
of neighboring valleys, are, from the very sequence of the
deposits, obviously worthless; and the only apparently constant
measure, namely, the fall of blocks from the roof, seems not to
have been applied, and Mr. Pengelly declares that it can not be
practically used. We are therefore quite uncertain as to the
number of centuries involved in the filling of this cave, and
must remain so until some surer system of calculation can be
devised. We may, however, attempt to sketch the series of events
which it indicates.</p>

<p>The animals found in Kent's Hole are all "postglacial," some of
them of course survivors from "preglacial" times,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
and some of them still surviving. They therefore inhabited the country after
it rose from the great glacial submergence. Perhaps the first
colonists of the coast of Devonshire in this period were the cave
bears, migrating on floating ice, and subsisting like the arctic
bear and the black bear of Anti-costi, on fish, and on the
garbage cast up by the sea. They may have found Kent's Hole a
sea-side cavern, with perhaps some of its galleries still full of
water and filling with breccia, with which the bones of dead
bears became mixed. In the case of such a deposit as this
breccia, however, the precise time when its materials were
finally laid down in their present form, or the length of time
necessary for its accumulation, can not be definitely settled. It
may be a result of continued torrential action or of some sudden
cataclysm. As the land rose, these creatures for the most part
betook themselves to lower levels, and in process of time the
cavern stood upon a hill-side, perhaps several hundreds of feet
above the sea; and the mountain streams, their beds not yet
emptied of glacial detritus, washed into it stones and mud, and
probably bones also, while it appears that hyenas occupied the
cave at intervals, and dragged in remains of mammals of many
species which had now swarmed across the plains elevated out of
the sea, and multiplied in the land. This was the time of the
cave earth; and before its deposit was completed, though how long
before an unstratified and therefore probably often-disturbed bed
of this kind can not tell, man himself seems to have been added
to the inhabitants of the British land. In pursuit of game he
sometimes ascended the valleys beyond the cavern, or even
penetrated into its outer chambers; or perhaps there were even in
those days rude and savage hill-men, inhabiting the forests and
warring with the more cultivated denizens of plains below, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
are now deep under the waters. Their weapons, and other
implements dropped in the cavern or lost in hunting, or buried in
the flesh of wounded animals which crept to the streams to
assuage their thirst, are those found in the cave earth. The
absence of the human bones may merely show that the mighty
hunters of those days were too hardy, athletic, and intelligent
often to perish from accidental causes, and that they did not use
this cavern for a place of burial. The fragments of charcoal show
that they were acquainted with fire, and possibly that they
sometimes took shelter in the cave. But the land again subsided.
The valley of that now nameless river, of which the Rhine and the
Thames may have alike been tributaries, disappeared under the
sea; and perhaps some tribe, driven from the lower lands, took up
its abode in this cave, now again near the encroaching waves, and
left there the remains of their last repasts ere they were driven
farther inland or engulfed in the waters. For a time the cavern
may have been wholly submerged, and the charcoal of the
extinguished fires became covered with its thin coating of clay.
But ere long it re-emerged to form part of an island, long barren
and desolate; and the valleys having been cut deeper by the
receding waters, it no longer received muddy deposits, and the
crust formed by drippings from its roof contained only bones and
pebbles washed by rains and occasional land floods from its own
clay deposits. Finally, the modern forests overspread the land,
and were tenanted by the modern animals. Man returned to use the
cavern again as a place of refuge or habitation, and to leave
there the relics contained in the black earth. This seems at
present the only intelligible history of this curious cave and
others resembling it; though, when we consider the imperfection
of the results obtained even by a large amount of labor, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the difficult and confused character of the deposits in this and
similar caves, too much value should not be attached to such
histories, which may at any time be contradicted or modified by
new facts or different explanations of those already known. The
time involved depends very much on the answer to the question
whether we should regard the postglacial subsidence and
re-elevation as somewhat sudden, or as occupying long ages at the
slow rate at which some parts of our continents are now rising or
sinking.</p>

<p>Mr. Pengelly thinks it possible, but not proved, that the lower
breccia of Kent's Cavern may be interglacial or preglacial in
age. One case only is known where a human bone has been found in
a cavern under deposits supposed to be of the nature of the
glacial drift. It is that of the Victoria Cave, at Settle, in
Yorkshire. At this place a human fibula was found under a layer
of boulder clay. But there are too many chances of this bone
having come into this position by some purely local accident to
allow us to attach much importance to it until future discoveries
shall have supplied other instances of the kind.
<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>I may close this survey of the cave deposits with a summary of
the results of M. Dupont, as obtained from two of the caves
explored by him, that of Margite and that of Frontal. In the
first of these caverns, resting on rolled pebbles which covered
the floor, were four distinct layers of river mud deposited by
inundations, and amounting to two yards and a half in thickness.
In all of these layers were bones. The lowest contained rude
flint implements, and bones of the mammoth, rhinoceros, bear,
horse, chamois, reindeer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
stag, and hyena. In the overlying
deposits are some flint implements of more artistic form and a
greater prevalence of the bones of the reindeer. In the second
cave, that of Frontal, over a similar deposit of alluvial mud of
the mammoth age, was found a sepulchre containing the remains of
sixteen individuals, of the second or diminutive Lappish race
before referred to. The door of the cave had been closed by these
people with a slab of stone, and in front was a hearth for
funeral feasts, built on the deposits of the mammoth age, and
containing bones of animals all recent or now living in Belgium,
and without any traces of the bones of the extinct quadrupeds.
This burial-place belonged to the Neocosmic yet prehistoric race
which replaced the Pal&aelig;ocosmic men of the mammoth age.</p>

<p>What is the absolute antiquity of the Pal&aelig;ocosmic age in Europe?
We have no monumental or historical chronology to answer this
question, but only the measures of time furnished by the
accumulation of deposits, by the deposition of stalagmite, by the
gradual extinction of animals, and by the erosion of valleys and
other physical changes. These somewhat loose measures have been
applied in various ways, but the tendency of geologists, from the
prevalence of uniformitarian views, and the prejudice created by
familiarity with the long times of previous geologic periods, has
been to assign to them too great rather than too little value,
both as measures of time and as indicating a remote antiquity.</p>

<p>With reference to the accumulation of deposits, whether derived
from disintegration of the roof and walls of the cave, introduced
by land floods or river inundations or by the residence of man,
their rate is of very difficult estimation. Loose stones fallen
from the roof, as in the case of Kent's Cave, would give a fair
measure of time if we could be sure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
that the climate had continued uniform, and that there had been no violent
earthquakes. Mr. Pengelly has, however, hopelessly given up this
kind of evidence. Where, as in the case of many of these caves,
land floods and river inundations have entered, these may have
been frequent or separated by long intervals of time, and they
may have been of great or small amount. Where, for instance, as
in one of the Belgian caves, there are six beds of ossiferous
mud, but for the fact that five layers of stalagmite separate
them we might not have known whether they represent six annual
inundations, or floods separated by many centuries from each
other.</p>

<p>In the case of the Victoria Cave at Settle, Dawkins, reasoning
from the accumulation of two feet of detritus over British
remains that may be supposed to be 1200 years old, gives a basis
which would at the same rate of deposit allow about 5000 years
for the date of pal&aelig;olithic men; but Prestwich and others, on the
basis of stalagmite deposits, claim a vastly higher antiquity for
the men who made the implements found in Kent's Hole and Brixham.</p>

<p>If we now turn to these stalagmite floors, when we consider that
they have been formed by the slow solution of limestone by
rain-water charged with carbonic acid, and the dropping of this
water on the floor, and when we are told that in Kent's Cavern a
marked date shows that the stalagmite has grown at the rate of
only one twentieth of an inch since 1688, and that there are two
beds of stalagmite, one of which is in some places twelve feet
thick, we are impressed with the conviction of a vast antiquity.
But when we are told by Dawkins that the rate of deposit in
Ingleborough Cave may be estimated at a quarter of an inch per
annum, and when we consider that the present rate of deposit in
Kent's Hole is probably very different from what it was in the
former condition of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
country, stalagmite becomes a very
unsafe measure of time. With respect again to the accumulation of
kitchen-midden stuff in the course of the occupancy of caverns,
this proceeds with great rapidity, when caves are steadily
occupied and it is not the practice to cleanse out the d&eacute;bris of
fires, food, and bedding. Even when the occupation is temporary,
a tribe of savages engaged with the preparation of dried meat and
pemmican in a very short time produce a considerable heap of
bones and other rejectamenta.</p>

<p>Looking next to the extinction of animals, we find that the
species found in the oldest deposits containing human remains are
in part still extant. Others which are locally extinct we know
existed in Europe until historical times, that is, within the
last two thousand years. How long previously to this the others
became extinct we have no certain means of knowing, though it
seems probable that they disappeared gradually and successively.
We have, however, farther to bear in mind the possibility of
cataclysms or climatal changes which may have proved speedily
fatal to many species over large areas. In any case we have this
certain fact that, though the time elapsed has been sufficient
for the extinction of many species, it does not seem to have
sufficed to effect any noteworthy change on those that survived.
Farther, we may consider that time is only one factor in this
matter, and not the one which is the efficient cause of change,
since we know no reason why one species of animal should not
continue to be reproduced as long as another, but for the
occurrence of physical changes of a prejudicial character.</p>

<p>We have still remaining the changes which have taken place in the
erosion of valleys since the caverns were occupied. Dupont
informs us that the openings of some of the caverns once flooded
by rivers are now in limestone cliffs two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
hundred feet above the water, while no appreciable lowering of the bottoms of the
ravines is taking place now. This would in some contingencies put
back the period of filling of the caves to an indefinite
antiquity. But then the questions occur&mdash;Was there once more
water in the rivers or more obstruction at their outlets, or was
the erosive power greater at one time than now, or were the river
valleys excavated in still more ancient time, and partly filled
with mud when the water entered the caves, and may this mud have
been since swept away? So, in like manner, the waters flowing in
the channels near Brixham Cave and Kent's Hole were apparently
about seventy feet higher in times of flood than at present, but
the time involved is subject to the same doubts as in the case of
the Belgian caves. Hughes has well remarked that elevations of
the land, by causing rivers to form waterfalls and cascades,
which they cut back, may greatly accelerate the rate of erosion.
Farther, there is the best reason to believe that in the glacial
period many old valleys were filled with clay, and that the
modern cutting consisted merely in the removal of this clay. Belt
has shown in a recent paper
<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
 good reason to believe that this
is the case with the Falls of Niagara, and that the cutting
actually effected through rock within the later Pleistocene and
modern period has been that only of the new gorge from the
whirlpool to Queenstown, the main part of the ravine being of
older date and merely re-excavated. This would greatly reduce the
ordinary estimate of time based on the cutting of the Niagara
gorge.</p>

<p>This leads us next to consider the occurrence of human remains
and objects of art in the river-gravels themselves, and the
amount of excavation and deposit involved in the deposition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
of these gravels. In the river-gravels of the Somme, and of many
other rivers in France and Southern England, chipped flints and
rude flint implements are found in so great quantity as to imply
that the beds and banks of these streams were resorted to for
flint material, and that the unfinished and rejected implements
left in the holes and trenches, or on the heaps where the work
was carried on, were afterward sorted by running water, perhaps
in abnormal floods and debacles, such as occur in all river
valleys occasionally, perhaps in that great diluvial catastrophe
which seems to have terminated the residence of Pal&aelig;ocosmic man
in Europe. Wilson has well shown how the heaps left by American
tribes in and near their flint quarries would furnish the
material for such accumulations. The time required for the
erosion of the valleys and the deposit of the gravels has been
very variously estimated. In the case of the Somme, which river
is not appreciably deepening its bed, if we suppose it to have
cut its wide valley to the depth of one hundred and fifty feet
out of solid chalk since the so-called "high level" gravels of
France and the South of England were deposited, the time required
shades off into infinity. So Evans, in his work on "The Ancient
Stone Implements of Great Britain," looking upon the amount of
excavation of wide and deep valleys since the stone implements of
Bournemouth are supposed to have been deposited in gravel, says,
"Who can fully comprehend how immensely remote was the epoch when
that vast bay was high and dry land?" and he becomes poetical in
delineating the view that must have met the eyes of "pal&aelig;olithic"
man. And undoubtedly, if one is to be limited to the precise
nature and amount of causes now at work in the district, the time
must not only be "immensely remote," but illimitably so. The
difficulty lies with the exaggerated uniformitarianism of the
supposition that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
such causes could have produced the results.
But, for reasons to be immediately stated, the time required is
liable to numerous deductions; and recently Tylor, Pattison,
Collard, and others have insisted ably on these deductions, as
has also Professor Hughes, of Cambridge. I have myself urged them
strongly in the work already referred to.</p>

<p>In the first place, when we see a deep river valley in which the
present stream is doing an almost infinitesimal amount of
deepening, we are not to infer that this represents all its work
past and present. In times of unusual flood it may do in one week
more than in many previous years. Farther, if there have been
elevations or depressions of the land, when the land has been
raised the cutting power has at once been enormously increased,
and when depressed it has been diminished, or filling has taken
the place of cutting. Again, if the climate in time past has been
more extreme, or the amount of rainfall greater, the cutting
action has then been proportionally rapid. Perhaps no influence
is greater in this respect than that which is known to the
colonists in Northeastern America as "ice-freshets," when in
spring, before the ice has had time to disappear from the rivers,
sudden thaws and rains produce great floods, which rushing down
over the icy crust, or breaking and hurling its masses before
them, work terrible havoc on the banks and alluvial flats,
depositing great beds of gravel, and sweeping away immense masses
that had lain undisturbed for centuries. Now we know that in
Europe the human period was preceded by what has been termed the
glacial age, and as it was passing away there must have been
unexampled floods and ice-freshets, and a temporary "pluvial
period," as it has been called, in which the volume of the rivers
was immensely increased. Farther, it is an established fact that
the period of the appearance of man was a time when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
the continents in the northern hemisphere were more elevated than at
present, and when consequently the cutting action of rivers was
at a maximum. This was again followed by a period of depression,
accompanied probably by many local cataclysms, if not by a
general deluge; and there are strong geological reasons to
believe that this convulsion was connected with the disappearance
from Europe of Pal&aelig;ocosmic man, and many of the animals his
contemporaries. This view I advocated some time ago in my "Story
of the Earth;" and more recently Mr. Pattison, in an able paper
read before the Victoria Institute, has developed it in greater
detail, and supported it by a great mass of geological authority.
If the Pal&aelig;ocosmic period was one of continental elevation, when
the greater seats of population were in the valleys of great
rivers now covered by the German Ocean and the English Channel,
and when the valleys of the Thames and the Somme were those of
upland streams frequented by straggling parties and small tribes,
and the seats of extensive flint factories for the supply of the
plains below, and if this state of things was terminated by a
diluvial debacle, we can account for all the phenomena of the
drift implements without any extravagant estimate of time.</p>

<p>I quote with much pleasure on this subject the following from the
report of a lecture on "Geological Measures of Time," by
Professor Hughes, before the Royal Institution of London. Hughes
was, like myself, a companion of Sir Charles Lyell in some of his
journeys, though belonging to a younger generation of geologists,
and is an accurate observer and reasoner.</p>

<p>"Another method of estimating the lapse of time is founded upon
the supposed rate at which rivers scoop out their channels.
Although no very exact estimates have been attempted,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
still the immense quantity of work that has been done, as compared with the
slow rate at which a river is now excavating that same part of
the valley, is often appealed to as a proof of a great lapse of
time.</p>

<p>"The fact of such an enormous lapse of time is not questioned,
but this part of the evidence is challenged.</p>

<p>"The previous considerations of the rate of accumulation of silt
on the low lands prepares us to inquire whether there is any
waste at all along the alluvial plains. Several examples were
given to show that the lowering of valleys was brought about by
receding rapids and waterfalls; for instance, following up the
Rhine, its terraces could often be traced back to where the
waterfall was seen to produce at once almost all the difference
of level between the river reaches above and below it. At
Schaffhausen the river terrace below the hotel could be traced
back and found to be continuous with the river margin above the
fall. The wide plains occurring here and there, such as the
Mayence basin, were due to the river being arrested by the hard
rocks of the gorges below Bingen so long that it had time to wind
from side to side through the soft rocks above the gorges. When
waterfalls cut back to such basins or to lakes they would recede
rapidly, tapping the waters of the lake, eating back the soft
beds of the alluvial plains, and probably in both cases leaving
terraces as evidence, not of upheavals or of convulsions, but of
the arrival of a waterfall which had been gradually travelling up
the valley. So when the Rhone cuts back from the falls at
Belgarde we shall have terraces where now is the shore of Geneva;
so also when the Falls of Schaffhausen, and ages afterward when
the Falls of Laufenburg have tapped the Lake of Constance, there
will be terraces marking its previous levels. And so we may
explain the former greater extent of the Lake of Zurich, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
stood higher and spread wider by Utznach and Wetzikon before it
was tapped by the arrival of waterfalls, which cut back into it
and let its waters run off until they fell to their present
level.</p>

<p>"A small upheaval near the mouth of a river would have a similar
effect. The Thames below London and the Somme below St. Acheul
can now only just hand on the mud brought down from higher
ground; but suppose an elevation of a hundred feet over those
parts of England and France (quite imperceptible if extended over
10,000, 1000, or even 100 years), and the rivers would tumble
over soft mud and clay and chalk, and soon eat their way back
from Sheppey to London, and from St. Valery to Amiens.</p>

<p>"So when we want to estimate the age of the gravels on the top of
the cliff at the Reculvers, or on the edge of the plateau of St.
Acheul, we have to ask, not how long would it take the rivers to
cut down to their present level from the height of those gravels
at the rate at which that part of their channel is being lowered
now, but how long would it take the Somme or Thames, which once
ran at the level of those gravels, to cut back from where its
mouth or next waterfall was then to where it runs over rapids
now. We ought to know what movements of upheaval and depression
there have been; what long alluvial flats or lakes which may have
checked floods, but also arrested the rock-protecting gravel; how
much the wash of the estuarine waves has helped. In fact, it is
clear that observations made on the action of the rivers at those
points now have nothing to do with the calculation of the age of
the terraces above, and that the circumstances upon which the
rate of recession of the waterfalls and rapids depends are so
numerous and changeable that it is at present unsafe to attempt
any estimate of the time required to produce the results
observed."</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
I may close this discussion by quoting from the paper of my
friend Mr. Pattison, already referred to, the following summing
up of his conclusions, in which I fully concur:</p>

<p>"We may assume it as established that there was a time when
England was connected with the Continent, when big animals
roamed in summer up the watercourses and across the uplands,
and man, armed only with rude stones, followed them into the
marshes and woods, hunted them for sustenance, and consumed
them in shelter of caves, then accessible from the river
levels. This state of things was continued until disturbed
by oscillations of surface, accompanied by excessive
rainfalls and rushes of water from the water-sheds of the
rivers, until the great animals were driven out or
destroyed, and man ceased to visit these parts. The
disturbances continued, the Strait of Dover was formed, the
configuration of the soft parts of the islands and
continents was fixed, action subsided, and the present state
of things obtained. Man resumed his residence, but with loss
of the mammoth and its companions. The reindeer now
constituted the type of a state of things which lasted down
to the historic period, without any other from that time to
this. * * *</p>

<p>"Chronologists are agreed that about 2000 years B.C. Abraham
migrated from Mesopotamia to Canaan, and that at this time
Egypt at least was old in civilization. Beyond this we have
no positive scale of time in Scripture; for it is evident,
from the narrative itself, that the latter does not cover
the whole time. * * *</p>

<p>"Ussher estimates from Scripture the creation of man as
about 2000 years before this. During the latter portion of
this time civilization was proceeding under settled
governments in the East, interrupted, says the record and
tradition, by a flood. * * *</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"So Lucretius:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;font-size:90%">'Thus, too, the insurgent waters once o'erpowered,<br />
As fables tell, and deluged many a state;<br />
Till, in its turn, the congregated waves<br />
By cause more potent conquered, heaven restrain'd<br />
Its ceaseless torrents, and the flood decreased.'</p>

<p>Barbarism covered the whole Western world; neither in the
2000 years before Abraham, nor in the 2000 years afterward,
have we any light reflected from these regions to the East.
In this 4000 years, or in the somewhat longer period which
probably will be ultimately settled as warranted by the
record, we place hypothetically all the phenomena of the
later mammalian age, including the introduction of man as a
hunter, the first occupation of the caves by him also, the
diluvial phenomena of the wide valleys, the oscillations and
disturbances of the earth's crust, alterations in the
coast-line, and physical settlement of the country; after
this comes the second occupation of the caves. In short, if
we say that, hypothetically, the whole first known human age
occurred within 4000 years of the Christian era, no one can
say that it is geologically impossible. Who can say that
1643 years is insufficient to comprise all the phenomena
that occurred during a period confessedly characterized by
more rapid and extensive action than at present&mdash;a period
during which ruptures in the earth's crust, oscillations,
and permanent uprising took place, and the intermittent
action of violent floods caused the deposit and disturbance
and resettlement of the gravels and brick-earth? There is
nothing to interfere with the prevalent opinion that man was
introduced here while the glacial period was dying out, and
while it was still furnishing flood-waters sufficient to
scour and re-sort the gravels of the valleys down which they
flowed. This supposition may be extended to both the great
continents."</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
To conclude: Our mode of reconciling the Mosaic history of
antediluvian man with the disclosures of the gravels and caves
would be to identify Pal&aelig;ocosmic man, or man of the mammoth age,
with antediluvian man; to suppose that the changes which closed
his existence in Europe as well as Western Asia were those
recorded in the Noachian deluge; and that the second colonization
of the diminished and shrunken Europe of the modern period was
effected by the descendants of Noah. It may be asked&mdash;Must we
suppose that the Adam of the Bible was of the type of the
coarsely featured and gigantic men of the European caverns? I
would answer&mdash;Not precisely so; but it is quite possible that
Adam may have been Turanian in feature. We should certainly
suppose him to have been a man well developed in brain and
muscle. Such men as those found in the caves would rather
represent the ruder "Nephelim," the "giants that were in those
days," than Adam in Eden. Farther, the new colonists of Europe
after the deluge would no doubt be a very rude and somewhat
degenerate branch of Noachid&aelig;, probably driven before more
powerful tribes in the course of the dispersion. The higher races
of both periods are probably to be looked for in Western Asia;
but even there we must expect to find cave men like those whose
remains were found by Tristram in the caves near Tyre, and like
the Horim of Moses; and we must also expect to find the
antediluvian age in the main an age of stone everywhere, and its
arts, except in certain great centres of population, perhaps not
more advanced than those of the Polynesians, or those of the
agricultural American tribes before the discovery of America by
Columbus.</p>

<p>As a geologist, and as one who has been in the main of the school
of Lyell, and after having observed with much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
care the deposits of the more modern periods on both sides of the Atlantic, I have
from the first dissented from those of my scientific brethren who
have unhesitatingly given their adhesion to the long periods
claimed for human history, and have maintained that their hasty
conclusions on this subject must bring geological reasoning into
disrepute, and react injuriously on our noble science. We require
to make great demands on time for the prehuman periods of the
earth's history, but not more than sacred history is willing to
allow for the modern or human age.</p>

"Lo, these are but the outlines of his ways, and how faint

<p>In the preceding pages I have, as far as possible, avoided that
mode of treating my subject which was wont to be expressed as the
"reconciliation" of Scripture and Natural Science, and have
followed the direct guidance of the Mosaic record, only turning
aside where some apt illustration or coincidence could be
perceived. In the present chapter I propose to inquire what the
science of the earth teaches on these same subjects, and to point
out certain manifest and remarkable correspondences between these
teachings and those of revelation. Here I know that I enter on
dangerous ground, and that if I have been so fortunate as to
carry the intelligent reader with me thus far, I may chance to
lose him now. The Hebrew Scriptures are common property; no one
can fairly deny me the right to study them, even though I do so
in no clerical or theological capacity; and even if I should
appear extreme in some of my views, or venture to be almost as
enthusiastic as the commentators of Homer, Shakespeare, or Dante,
I can not be very severely blamed. But the direct comparison of
these ancient records with results of modern science is obnoxious
to many minds on different grounds; and all the more so that so
few men are at once students both of nature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and revelation. There are, as yet, but few even of educated men whose range of
study has included any thing that is practical or useful either
in Hebrew literature or geological science. That slipshod
Christianity which contents itself with supposing that
conclusions which are false in nature may be true in theology is
mere superstition or professional priestcraft, and has nothing in
common with the Bible; but there are still multitudes of good
men, trained in the verbal and abstract learning which at one
time constituted nearly the whole of education, who regard
geology as a mass of crude hypotheses destitute of coherence, a
perpetual battle-ground of conflicting opinions, all destined in
time to be swept away. It must be admitted, too, that from the
nature of geological evidence, and from the liability to error in
details, the solidity of its conclusions is not likely soon to be
appreciated as fully as is desirable by the common mind; while it
is unfortunately true that the outskirts of science are infested
with hosts of half-informed and superficial writers, who state
these conclusions incorrectly, or apply them in an unreasonable
manner to matters on which they have no bearing. On the other
hand, the geologist, fully aware of the substantial nature of the
foundations of the science of the earth, regards it as little
less than absurd to find parallels to its principles in an
ancient theological work. Still there are possible meeting-points
of things so dissimilar as Bible lore and geological exploration.
If man is a being connected on the one hand with material nature,
and on the other with the spiritual essence of the Creator; if
that Creator has given to man powers of exploring and
comprehending his plans in the universe, and at the same time has
condescended to reveal to him directly his will on certain
points, there is nothing unphilosophical or improbable in the
supposition that the same truths may be struck out on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the one hand by the action of the human mind on nature, and on the other
by the action of the Divine mind on that of man. The highest and
most nobly constituted minds have ever been striving to scale
heaven above and dive into the earth below, that they may extort
from them the secret of their origin, and may find what are the
privileges and destinies of man himself. They have learned much;
and if through other gifted minds, and through his
heaven-descended Word and Spirit, God has condescended to reveal
himself, there must surely be much in common in that which God's
works teach to earnest inquirers and that which he directly makes
known. But few of our greatest thinkers, whether on nature or
theology, have reached the firm ground of this higher
probability; or if they have reached it, have dreaded the scorn
of the half-learned too much to utter their convictions. Still
this is a position which the enlightened Christian and student of
nature must be prepared to occupy, humbly and with admission of
much ignorance and incapacity, but with bold assertion of the
truth that there are meeting-points of nature and revelation
which afford legitimate subjects of study.</p>

<p>In entering on these subjects, we may receive certain great
truths in reference to the history of the earth as established by
geological evidence. In the present rapidly progressive state of
the science, however, it is by no means easy to separate its
assured and settled results from those that have been founded on
too hasty generalization, or are yet immature; and at the same
time to avoid overlooking new and important truths, sufficiently
established, yet not known in all their dimensions. In the
following summary I shall endeavor to present to the reader only
well-ascertained general truths, without indulging in those
deviations from accuracy for effect too often met with in popular
books. On the other hand, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
have already found that the
Scriptures enunciate distinct doctrines on many points relating
to the earth's early history, to which it will here be necessary
merely to refer in general terms. Let us in the first place
shortly consider the conclusions of geology as to the origin and
progress of creation.</p>

<p>1. The widest and most important generalization of modern geology
is that all the materials of the earth's crust, to the greatest
depth that man can reach, either by actual excavation or
inference from superficial arrangements, are of such a nature as
to prove that they are not, in their present state, original
portions of the earth's structure; but that they are the results
of the operation, during long periods, of the causes of
change&mdash;whether mechanical, chemical, or vital&mdash;now in operation,
on the land, in the seas, and in the interior of the earth. For
example, the most common rocks of our continents are
conglomerates, sandstones, shales, and slates; all of which are
made up of the d&eacute;bris of older rocks broken down into gravel,
sand, or mud, and then re-cemented. To these we may add
limestones, which have been made up by the accumulation of corals
and shells, or by deposits from calcareous springs; coal,
composed of vegetable matter; and granite, syenite, greenstone,
and trap, which are molten rocks formed in the manner of modern
lavas. So general has been this sorting, altering, and
disturbance of the substance of the earth's crust, that, though
we know its structure over large portions of our continents to
the depth of several miles, the geologist can point to no
instance of a truly primitive rock which can be affirmed to have
remained unchanged and <i>in situ</i> since the beginning.</p>

<p>"All are aware that the solid parts of the earth consist of
distinct substances, such as clay, chalk, sand, limestone, coal,
slate, granite, and the like; but, previously to observation, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
is commonly imagined that all had remained from the first in the
state in which we now see them&mdash;that they were created in their
present forms and in their present position. The geologist now
comes to a different conclusion; discovering proofs that the
external parts of the earth were not all produced in the
beginning of things in the state in which we now behold them, nor
in an instant of time. On the contrary, he can show that they
have acquired their actual condition and configuration gradually
and at successive periods, during each of which distinct races of
living beings have flourished on the land and in the waters; the
remains of these creatures lying buried in the crust of the
earth."
<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>2. Having ascertained that the rocks of the earth have thus been
produced by secondary causes, we next affirm, on the evidence of
geology, that a distinct order of succession of these deposits
can be ascertained; and though there are innumerable local
variations in the nature of the rocks formed at the same period,
yet there is, on the great scale, a regular sequence of
formations over the whole earth. This succession is of the
greatest importance in the case of aqueous rocks, or those formed
in water; and it is evident that in the case of beds of sand,
clay, etc., deposited in this way, the upper must be the more
recent of any two layers. This simple principle, complicated in
various ways by the fractures and disturbances to which the beds
have been subjected, forms the basis of the succession of
"formations" in geology as deduced from stratigraphical evidence.</p>

<p>3. This regular series of formations would be of little value as
a history of the earth were it not that nearly all the aqueous
rocks contain remains of the contemporary animals and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
plants. Ever since the earth began to be tenanted by organized beings,
the various accumulations formed in the bottoms of seas and at
the mouths of rivers have entombed remains of marine animals,
more especially their harder parts, as shells, corals, and bones,
and also fragments or entire specimens of land animals and
plants. Hence, in any rock of aqueous formation, we may find
fossil remains of the living creatures that existed in the waters
in which that rock was accumulated or on the neighboring land. If
in the process of building up the continents, the same locality
constituted in succession a part of the bottom of the ocean, of
an inland sea, of an estuary, and a lake, we should find in the
fossil remains entombed in the deposits of that place evidences
of these various conditions; and thus a somewhat curious history
of local changes might be obtained. Geology affords more
extensive disclosures of this nature. It shows that as we descend
into the older formations we gradually lose sight of the existing
animals and plants, and find the remains of others not now
existing; and these, in turn, themselves disappear, and were
preceded by others; so that the whole living population of the
earth appears to have been several times renewed prior to the
beginning of the present order of things. This seems farther to
have occurred in a slow and gradual manner, not by successive
great cataclysms or clearances of the surface of the earth,
followed by wholesale renewal. This doctrine of geological
uniformity is, however, to be understood as limited by the
equally certain fact that there has been progress and advance,
both in the inorganic arrangements of the earth's surface and in
its organized inhabitants, and that there have, in geological as
in historical times, been local cataclysms and convulsions, as
those of earthquakes and volcanoes, often on a very extensive
scale. Farther, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
are good reasons to believe that there
have been alternations of cold or glacial periods and of warm
periods, of periods of subsidence and re-elevation, and of
periods of greater and less activity of certain of the leading
agents of geological change. But as to the extent of these
differences and their bearing on the geological history, there is
still much uncertainty and difference of opinion.
<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>In the sediment <i>now</i> accumulating in the bottom of the waters
are being buried remains of the existing animals and plants. A
geological formation is being produced, and it contains the
skeletons and other solid parts of a vast variety of creatures
belonging to all climates, and which have lived on land as well
as in fresh and salt water. Let us now suppose that by a series
of changes, sudden or gradual, all the present organized beings
were swept away, and that, when the earth was renewed by the
power of the Creator, a new race of intelligent beings could
explore those parts of the former sea basins that had been
elevated into land. They would find the remains of multitudes of
creatures not existing in their time; and by the presence of
these they could distinguish the deposits of the former period
from those that belonged to their own. They could also compare
these remains with the corresponding parts of creatures which
were their own contemporaries, and could thus infer the
circumstances in which they had lived, the modes of subsistence
for which they had been adapted, and the changes in the
distribution of land and water and other physical conditions
which had occurred. This, then, is precisely the place which
fossil organic remains occupy in modern geology, except that our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
present system of nature rests on the ruins, not of one previous
system, but of several.</p>

<p>4. By the aid of the superposition of deposits and their organic
remains, geology can divide the history of the earth into
distinct periods. These periods are not separated by merely
arbitrary boundaries, but to some extent mark important eras in
the progress of our earth; though they usually pass into each
other at their confines, and the nature of the evidence prevents
us from ascertaining the precise length of the periods
themselves, or the intervals in time which may separate the
several monuments by which they are distinguished. The following
table will serve to give an idea of the arrangement at present
generally received, with some of the more important facts in the
succession of animal and vegetable life, as connected with our
present subject. It commences with the oldest periods known to
geology, and gives in the animal and vegetable kingdoms the
<i>first appearance</i> of each class, with a few notes of the
subsequent history of the principal forms. It must, however, be
borne in mind that farther discoveries may extend some classes
farther back than we at present know them, and that a more
detailed table, descending to orders and families, would give a
more precise view of the succession of life. Farther, the several
geological formations would admit of much subdivision, and are
represented locally by various kinds and different thicknesses of

The oldest fossil remains known are the Protozoa of the
Laurentian rocks. In the succeeding Cambrian or Primordial rocks
we find many extinct species of zoophytes, shell-fish, and
crustaceans, and the alg&aelig; or sea-weeds. In the Pal&aelig;ozoic period
as a whole, though numerous Batrachian or Amphibian reptiles
existed toward its close, the higher orders of fishes seem to
have been the dominant tribe of animals; and vegetation was
nearly limited to cryptogams and gymnosperms. In the Mesozoic
period, though small mammalia had been created, large terrestrial
and marine reptiles were the ruling race, and fishes occupied a
subordinate position; while, at the close, the higher orders of
plants took a prominent place. In the Tertiary and Modern eras,
the mammalia, with man, have assumed the highest or dominant
position in nature.</p>

<p>On this series of groups, and the succession of living beings,
Sir. C. Lyell remarks "It is not pretended that the principal
sections called Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary are of
equivalent importance, or that the subordinate groups comprise
monuments relating to equal portions of time or of the earth's
history. But we can assert that they each relate to successive
periods, during which certain animals and plants, for the most
part peculiar to their respective eras, flourished, and during
which different kinds of sediment were deposited."</p>

<p>We have already, in previous chapters, noticed the parallelism of
the succession of life in the earth as revealed in Genesis with
that disclosed by geology; but this subject must be farther
referred to in the sequel, and in the mean time the reader may
compare for himself the succession of life in the table with that
in the later creative days.</p>

<p>5. The lapse of time embraced in the geological history of the
earth is enormous. Fully to appreciate this it is necessary to
study the science in detail, and to explore its phenomena as
disclosed in actual nature. A few facts, however, out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
of hundreds which might have been selected, will suffice to indicate
the state of the case. The delta and alluvial plain of the
Mississippi have an area of more than 12,000 square miles, and
must have an average depth of about 800 feet. At the present rate
of conveyance of sediment by the river, it has been calculated
that a period of about 33,000 years is implied in the deposition
of this comparatively modern formation.
<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
To be quite safe, let us take 30,000 years, and add 50,000 more for the remainder
of the Post-pliocene or Quaternary. We may then safely multiply
this number by forty, for the length of the Tertiary period. We
may add three times as much for the Mesozoic period, and this
will be far under the truth. It will then be quite safe to assume
that the Pal&aelig;ozoic period was three times as long as the Mesozoic
and Tertiary together. This would give altogether, say,
51,280,000 years for the whole of geological time from the
beginning of the Pal&aelig;ozoic, leaving the duration of the Eozoic
and previous periods undetermined, but requiring perhaps nearly
as much time. Great though these demands may seem, they would be
probably far below the rigid requirements of the case were it not
for the probability that the present rate of transference of
material by the great river is less than it was in Post-pliocene
and early modern times. This might enable us to reduce our
estimate considerably within the scope of a hundred millions of
years.
<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Take another illustration from an older formation. An
excellent coast section at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the Joggins, in Nova Scotia, exhibits
in the coal formation proper a series of beds with erect trunks
and roots of trees <i>in situ</i>, amounting to nearly 100. About 100
forests have successively grown, partially decayed, and been
entombed in muddy and sandy sediment. In the same section,
including in all about 14,000 feet of beds, there are 76 seams of
coal, each of which can be proved to have taken more time for its
accumulation than that required for the growth of a forest.
Supposing all these separate fossil soils and coals to have been
formed with the greatest possible rapidity, forty thousand years
would be a very moderate calculation for this portion of the
Carboniferous system; and for aught that we know thousands of
years may be represented by a single fossil soil. But this is the
age of only one member of the Carboniferous system, itself only a
member of the great Pal&aelig;ozoic group, and we have made no
allowance for the abrasion from previous rocks and deposition of
the immense mass of sandy and muddy sediment in which the coals
and forests are imbedded, and which is vastly greater than the
deltas of the largest modern rivers.</p>

<p>Considerations of a physical rather than of a geological nature
also give us long periods for the probable existence of the
earth, though they serve to correct somewhat the extravagant
estimates of some theorists. Croll has based an interesting
calculation on the amount of erosion of the land by rivers. That
of the Mississippi amounts to one foot in 6000 years. That of the
Ganges gives one foot in 2358 years, the average being, say, one
foot in 4179 years. Some smaller rivers give a much shorter time;
but the average of two great rivers, one draining a very large
area of the western and another of the eastern hemisphere, and in
very different climates and geographical conditions, will
probably be the most reliable datum.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Croll, however, prefers the
Mississippi rate.
<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
If we estimate the proportion of land to
water as 576 to 1390, this will give for the entire area of the
ocean a rate of deposition of one foot in 14,400 years. Now the
entire thickness of all the stratified rocks is estimated at
72,000 feet; and at this rate the enormous time of 1,036,800,000
years would be necessary. But we have no right to assume that
deposition has been going on uniformly over the entire
sea-bottom. On the contrary, the greater part of it takes place
within a belt of about one hundred miles from the coasts, and the
deposit of calcareous and other matters over the remainder will
scarcely make up for the portions of this belt on which no
deposit is taking place. This will give an area of deposit of
about 11,650,000 square miles, consequently only one twelfth of
the above time, or about 86,400,000 years, would be required.
This can be but a very rough calculation; but it has the merit of
squaring very nearly with the calculations derived from physical
considerations, more especially by Sir William Thomson, which
limit the possible existence of the earth's solid crust to one
hundred millions of years. Similar conclusions have also been
deduced from what is known of the physical constitution of the
sun. Croll's own ingenious theory of glacial periods produced by
the varying eccentricity of the earth's orbit, along with the
precession of the equinoxes, would give, according to him, about
80,000 years ago for the date of the Glacial period, and for the
beginning of the Tertiary period about 3,000,000 years ago.</p>

<p>It would thus appear that physical and geological science
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
conspire in assigning a great antiquity to the earth, but not an
unlimited antiquity. They agree in restricting the ages that have
elapsed since the introduction of life within one hundred
millions of years. I confess, however, that a consideration of
the fact that all our geological measures of erosion and
deposition seem to be based on cases which refer to what may be
termed minimum action leads me to believe that the actual time
will fall very far within this limit. For example, if we were to
suppose an elevation of the land drained by the Mississippi even
to a small amount, its cutting power would be vastly increased
for a long time. The same effect would result from a subsidence
and re-elevation, or from any cause increasing the amount of
rainfall or deposition of snows in winter. Now we know that such
things have occurred in the past, while we have no reason to
believe that the amount of action was ever much less than at
present. Similar considerations apply to nearly all our
geological measures of time; and there has been a tendency to
exaggerate these, as if geologists were entitled to demand
unlimited time, and to stretch the doctrine of uniformity to the
utmost.</p>

<p>6. During the whole time referred to by geology, the great laws
both of inorganic and organic nature have been the same as at
present. The evidence of light and darkness, of sunshine and
shower, of summer and winter, and of all the known igneous and
aqueous causes of change, extends back almost, and in some of
these cases altogether, to the beginning of the Pal&aelig;ozoic period.
In like manner the animals and plants of the oldest rocks are
constructed on the same physiological and anatomical principles
with existing tribes, and they can be arranged in the same
genera, orders, or classes, though specifically distinct. The
revolutions of the globe have involved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
no change of the general laws of matter; and though it is possible that geology has
carried us back to the time when the laws that regulate life
began to operate, it does not show that they were less perfect
than now, and it indicates no trace of the beginning of the
inorganic laws. Geological changes have resulted not from the
institution of new laws, but from new <i>dispositions</i>, under
existing laws and general arrangements. There is every reason to
believe that in the inorganic world these dispositions have
required no new creative interpositions during the time to which
geology refers, but merely the continued action of the properties
bestowed on matter when first produced. In the organic world the
case is different.</p>

<p>7. In the succession of animal and vegetable life we find a
constant improvement and advance by the introduction of new types
of being. We have already given a general outline of this
advancement of organized nature. It has consisted in the
introduction, from time to time, of new and more highly organized
beings, so as at once to increase the variety of nature, and to
provide for the elevation of the summit of the graduated scale of
life to higher and higher points. At the same time, in each
successive period, it has been the law of creation that the forms
of life then dominant should attain their highest development,
and should then be succeeded by more advanced types. For
instance, in the earlier Pal&aelig;ozoic period we have molluscous
animals and fishes, then apparently the highest forms of life,
appearing with a very advanced organization, not surpassed, if
even equalled, in modern times. In the latter part of the same
period, some lower forms of vegetable life, now restricted to a
comparatively humble place, were employed to constitute
magnificent forests. In the Mesozoic period, again, reptiles
attained to their highest point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
in organization and variety of form and employment, while mammalia had as yet scarcely
appeared.
<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>8. If now we ask in what manner the succession of life on the
earth has been produced, two apparently opposite hypotheses rise
before us. The one is that of introduction of new species by
creative acts, the other that of development of new species by
changes of those previously existing. In one respect the
difference of these views is little more than one of expression,
for the meaning of the statements depends on what we understand
by a species and what by a mere varietal form, and also on what
we understand by creation and what we mean by development. Twenty
years ago nearly all geologists were believers in creation,
though it must be admitted without precisely understanding what
they meant by the term. Now, the great impression produced by
Darwin's speculations and the prevalence of the evolutionist
philosophy have produced a leaning in the other direction. More
recently, however, the absurdities into which the extreme
evolutionists find themselves driven have produced a reaction;
and we hope that views consistent with revelation, or at least
with Theism, will again be in the ascendant, and that present
controversies will serve to give more precise and definite views
than heretofore of the relation of nature to God. As
illustrations of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the opinions prevalent before the rise of the
development theory, I may quote from Pictet and Bronn, two of the
most eminent pal&aelig;ontologists.</p>

<p>Pictet says, in the introduction to his "Trait&eacute; de
Pal&eacute;ontologie:" "It seems to me impossible that we should admit,
as an explanation of the phenomena of successive faunas, the
passage of species into one another; the limits of such
transitions of species, even supposing that the lapse of a vast
period of time may have given them a character of reality much
greater than that which the study of existing nature leads us to
suppose, are still infinitely within those differences which
distinguish two successive faunas. Lastly, we can least of all
account by this theory for the appearance of new <i>types</i>, to
explain the introduction of which we must necessarily, in the
present state of science, recur to the idea of distinct creations
posterior to the first."</p>

<p>The following are the general conclusions of Bronn, in his
elaborate and most valuable essay, presented to the French
Academy in 1856, as summarized in a notice of the work in the
Journal of the Geological Society:</p>

<p>"1. The first productions of this power in the oldest Neptunian
strata of the earth consisted of Plants, Zoophytes, Mollusks,
Crustaceans, and perhaps even Fish; the simultaneous appearance
of which, therefore, contradicts the assumption that the more
perfect organic forms arose out of the gradual transformation in
time of the more imperfect forms.</p>

<p>"2. The same power which produced the first organic forms has
continued to operate in intensively as well as extensively
increasing activity during the whole subsequent geological
period, up to the final appearance of man; but here also can no
traces be found of a gradual transformation of old species and
genera into new; but the new have every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
where appeared as new without the co-operation of the former.</p>

<p>"3. In the succession of the different forms of plants and
animals, a certain regular course and plan is perceptible, which
is quite independent of chance. While all species possess only a
limited duration, and must sooner or later disappear, they make
way for subsequent new ones, which not only almost always offer
an equivalent, in number, organization, and duties to be
performed, for those which have disappeared, but which are also
generally more varied, and therefore more perfect, and always
maintain an equilibrium with each other in their stage of
organization, their mode of life, and functions. There always
exists, therefore, a certain fixed relation between the newly
arising and the disappearing forms of organic life.</p>

<p>"4. A similar relation necessarily exists between the newly
arising organic forms and the outward conditions of life which
prevailed at their first appearance on the earth's surface, or at
the place of their appearance.</p>

<p>"5. A fixed plan appears to be the basis of the whole series of
development of organic forms, in so far as man makes his first
appearance at its close, when he finds every thing prepared that
is necessary to his own existence and to his progressive
development and improvement&mdash;which would not have been possible
had he appeared at a former period.</p>

<p>"6. Such a regular progress in carrying out the same plan from
the beginning to the end of a period of millions of years can
only be accounted for in one of two ways. Either this course of
successive development during millions of years has been the
regular immediate result of the systematic action of a conscious
Creator, who on every occasion settled and carried out not only
the order of appearance, formation, organization,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
and terrestrial object of each of the countless numbers of species of
plants and animals, but also the number of the first individuals,
the place of their settlement in every instance, although it was
in his power to create every thing at once&mdash;or there existed some
natural power hitherto entirely unknown to us, which by means of
its own laws formed the species of plants and animals, and
arranged and regulated all those countless individual conditions;
which power, however, must in this case have stood in the most
immediate connection with, and in perfect subordination to, those
powers which caused the gradually progressing perfection of the
crust of the earth, and the gradual development of the outward
conditions of life for the constantly increasing numbers and
higher classes of organic forms in consequence of this
perfection. Only in this way can we explain how the development
of the organic world could have regularly kept pace with that of
the inorganic. Such a power, although we know it not, would not
only be in perfect accordance with all the other functions of
nature, but the Creator, who regulated the development of organic
nature by means of such a force so implanted in it, as he guides
that of the inorganic world by the mere co-operation of
attraction and affinity, must appear to us more exalted and
imposing than if we assumed that he must always be giving the
same care to the introduction and change of the vegetable and
animal world on the surface of the earth as a gardener daily
bestows on each individual plant in the arrangement of his
garden.</p>

<p>"7. We therefore believe that all species of plants and animals
were originally produced by some natural power unknown to us, and
not by transformation from a few original forms, and that that
power was in the closest and most necessary connection with those
powers and circumstances which effected the perfection of the
earth's surface."</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Barrande also, probably the greatest living pal&aelig;ontologist of
Europe, adheres substantially to these views; as Agassiz did, and
I believe Hall and Dana still do, in America.</p>

<p>I have, for my own part, seen no reason to dissent from these
views, though in the sequel I shall endeavor to present some
considerations which may tend to reconcile with them some of the
hypotheses of a contrary nature now held. It must be admitted,
however, that the majority of geologists and biologists have
abandoned these views of Pictet and Bronn, and have gone over to
the evolutionist philosophy, with how little reason I have
endeavored to show elsewhere,
<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
and shall farther illustrate in the Appendix. Let it be observed, however, that even evolution
does not affect the grand idea of the unity of nature, or the
fact that the plan of the Creator in the organic world was so
vast that it required the whole duration of our planet, in all
its stages of physical existence, to embrace the whole. There is
but one system of organic nature; but, to exhibit the whole of
it, not only all the climates and conditions now existing are
required, but those also of all past geological periods. Further,
the progress of nature being mainly in the direction of
differentiation of functions once combined, it has a limit
backward in the most general forms and conditions, and forward in
the most specialized. This is the history of the individual and
probably also of the type, of the world itself and of the
universe; and for this reason material nature necessarily lacks
the eternity of its author.</p>

<p>It appears, from the above facts and reasonings, that geology
informs us&mdash;1. That the materials of our existing continents are
of secondary origin, as distinguished from primitive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
or coeval with the beginning. 2. That a chronological order of formation of
these rocks can be made out. 3. That the fossil remains contained
in the rocks constitute a chronology of animal and vegetable
existence. 4. That the history of the earth may be divided in
this way into distinct periods, all pre-Adamite. 5. That the
pre-Adamite periods were of enormous duration. 6. That during
these periods the existing general laws of nature were in force,
though the dispositions of inorganic nature were different in
different periods, and the animals and plants of successive
periods were also different from each other. 7. The introduction
of new species of animals and of plants, while indicating advance
in the perfection of nature, does not prove spontaneous
development, but rather a definite plan and law of creation.</p>

<p>The parallelism of these conclusions of careful inductive inquiry
into the structure of the earth's crust, with the results which
we have already obtained from revelation, may be summed up under
the following heads:</p>

<p>1. Scripture and Science both testify to the great fact that
there was a beginning&mdash;a time when none of all the parts of the
fabric of the universe existed; when the Self-Existent was the
sole occupant of space. The Scriptures announce in plain terms
this great truth, and thereby rise at once high above atheism,
pantheism, and materialism, and lay a broad and sure foundation
for a pure and spiritual theology. Had the pen of inspiration
written but the words, "In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth," and added no more, these words alone would have
borne the impress of their heavenly birth, and would, if received
in faith, have done much for the progress of the human mind.
These words contain a negation of hero-worship, star-worship,
animal-worship, and every other form of idolatry. They still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
more emphatically deny atheism and materialism, and point upward
from nature to its spiritual Creator&mdash;the One, the Triune, the
Eternal, the Self-Existent, the All-Pervading, the Almighty. They
call upon us, as with a voice of thunder, to bow down before that
Awful Being of whom it can be said that he created the heavens
and the earth. They thus embody the whole essence of natural
theology, and most appropriately stand at the entrance of Holy
Scripture, referring us to the works which men behold, as the
visible manifestation of the attributes of the Being whose
spiritual nature is unveiled in revelation. Scripture thus begins
with the announcement of a great ultimate fact, to which science
conducts us with but slow and timid steps. Yet science, and
especially geological science, can bear witness to this great
truth. The materialist, reasoning on the fancied stability of
natural things, and their inscription within invariable laws,
concludes that matter must be eternal. No, replies the geologist,
certainly not in its present form. This is but of recent origin,
and was preceded by other arrangements. Every existing species
can be traced back to a time when it was not; so can the existing
continents, mountains, and seas. Under our processes of
investigation the present melts away like a dream, and we are
landed on the shores of past and unknown worlds. But I read, says
the objector, that you can see "no evidence of a beginning, no
prospect of an end." It is true, answers geology; but, in so
saying, it is not intended that the present state of things had
not an ascertained beginning, but that there has been a great
and, so far as we know, unlimited series of changes carried on
under the guidance of intelligence. These changes we have traced
back very far, without being able to say that we have reached the
first. We can trace back man and his contemporaries to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
their origin, and we can reach the points at which still older
dynasties of life began to exist. Knowing, then, that all these
had a beginning, we infer that if others preceded them they also
had a beginning. But, says another objector, is not the present
the child of the past? Are not all the creatures that inhabit the
earth the lineal descendants of creatures of past periods, or may
not the whole be parts of one continual succession, under the
operation of an eternal law of development? No, answers geology,
species are immutable, except within narrow limits, and do not
pass into each other, in tracing them toward their origin. On the
contrary, they appear at once in their most perfect state, and
continue unchanged till they are forced off the stage of
existence to give place to other creatures. The origin of species
is a mystery, and belongs to no natural law that has yet been
established. Thus, then, stands the case at present. Scripture
asserts a beginning and a creation. Science admits these, as far
as the objects with which it is conversant extend, and the
notions of eternal succession and spontaneous development,
discountenanced both by theology and science, are obliged to take
refuge in those misty regions where modern philosophical
skepticism consorts with the shades of departed heathenism.
<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>2. Both records exhibit the progressive character of creation,
and in much the same aspect. The Almighty might have called into
existence, by one single momentary act, a world complete in all
its parts. From both Scripture and geology we know that he has
not done so&mdash;why we need not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
inquire, though we can see that the
process employed was that best adapted to show forth the variety
of his resources and the infinitely varied elements that enter
into the perfect whole.</p>

<p>The Scripture history may be viewed as dividing the progress of
the creation into two great periods, the later of which only is
embraced in the geological record. The first commences with the
original chaos, and reaches to the completion of inorganic nature
on the fourth day. Had we any geological records of the first of
these periods, we should perceive the evidences of slow
mutations, tending to the sorting and arrangement of the
materials of the earth, and to produce distinct light and
darkness, sea and land, atmosphere and cloud, out of what was
originally a mixture of the whole. We should also, according to
the Scriptural record, find this period interlocking with the
next, by the intervention of a great vegetable creation, before
the final adjustment of the earth's relations to the other bodies
of our system. The second period is that of the creative
development of animal life. From both records we learn that
various ranks or gradations existed from the first introduction
of animals; but that on the earlier stages only certain of the
lower forms of animals were present; that these soon attained
their highest point, and then gradually, on each succeeding
platform, the variety of nature in its higher&mdash;the
vertebrate&mdash;form increased, and the upper margin of animal life
attained a more and more elevated point, culminating at length in
man; while certain of the older forms were dropped, as no longer
required.</p>

<p>In the oldest fossiliferous rocks next to the Eozoic, which so
far have afforded only Protozoa&mdash;e. g., the Cambrian and Lower
Silurian&mdash;we find the mollusca represented mainly by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
their highest and lowest classes, by allies of the cuttle-fish and
nautilus, and by the lowest bivalve shell-fishes. The Articulata
are represented by the highest marine class&mdash;the crustaceans&mdash;and
by the lowest&mdash;the worms, which have left their marks on some of
the lowest fossiliferous beds. The Radiata, in like manner, are
represented by species of their highest class&mdash;the starfishes,
etc.&mdash;and by some of their simpler polyp forms. At the very
beginning, then, of the fossiliferous series, the three lower
sub-kingdoms exhibit species of their most elevated aquatic
classes, though not of the very highest orders in those classes.
The vertebrated sub-kingdom has, as far as yet known, no
representative in these lowest beds. In the Upper Silurian
series, however, we find remains of fishes; and in the succeeding
Devonian and carboniferous rocks the fishes rise to the highest
structures of their class; and we find several species of
reptiles, representing the next of the vertebrated classes in
ascending order. Here a very remarkable fact meets us. Before the
close of the Pal&aelig;ozoic period the three lower sub-kingdoms and
the fishes had already attained the highest perfection of which
their types are capable. Multitudes of new species and genera
were added subsequently, but none of them rising higher in the
scale of organization than those which occur in the Pal&aelig;ozoic
rocks. Thenceforth the progressive improvement of the animal
kingdom consisted in the addition, first of the reptile, which
attained its highest perfection and importance in the Mesozoic
period, and then of the bird and mammal, which did not attain
their highest forms till the Modern period. This geological order
of animal life, it is scarcely necessary to add, agrees perfectly
with that sketched by Moses, in which the lower types are
completed at once, and the progress is wholly in the higher.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
In the inspired narrative we have already noticed some
peculiarities, as, for instance, the early appearance of a highly
developed flora, and the special mention of great reptiles in the
work of the fifth day, which correspond with the significant fact
that high types of structure appeared at the very introduction of
each new group of organized beings&mdash;a fact which, more than any
other in geology, shows that, in the organic department,
elevation has always been a strictly <i>creative</i> work, and that
there is in the constitution of animal species no innate tendency
to elevation, but that on the contrary we should rather suspect a
tendency to degeneracy and ultimate disappearance, requiring that
the fiat of the Creator should after a time go out again to
"renew the face of the earth." In the natural as in the moral
world, the only law of progress is the will and the power of God.
In one sense, however, progress in the organic world has been
dependent on, though not caused by, progress in the inorganic. We
see in geology many grounds for believing that each new tribe of
animals or plants was introduced just as the earth became fitted
for it; and even in the present world we see that regions
composed of the more ancient rocks, and not modified by
subsequent disturbances, present few of the means of support for
man and the higher animals; while those districts in which
various revolutions of the earth have accumulated fertile soils
or deposited useful minerals are the chief seats of civilization
and population. In like manner we know that those regions which
the Bible informs us were the cradle of the human race and the
seats of the oldest nations are geologically among the most
recent parts of the existing continents, and were no doubt
selected by the Creator partly on that account for the birthplace
of man. We thus find that the Bible and the geologists are agreed
not only as to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
fact and order of progress, but also as to its manner and use.</p>

<p>3. Both records agree in affirming that since the beginning there
has been but one great system of nature. We can imagine it to
have been otherwise. Our existing nature might have been preceded
by a state of things having no connection with it. The
arrangements of the earth's surface might have been altogether
different; races of creatures might have existed having no
affinity with or resemblance to those of the present world, and
we might have been able to trace no present beneficial
consequences as flowing from these past states of our planet. Had
geology made such revelations as these, the consequences in
relation to natural theology and the credibility of Scripture
would have been momentous. The Mosaic narrative could scarcely,
in that case, have been interpreted in such a manner as to accord
with geological conclusions. The questions would have arisen&mdash;Are
there more creative Powers than one? If one, is He an imperfect
or capricious being who changes his plans of operation? The
divine authority of the Scriptures, as well as the unity and
perfections of God, might thus have been involved in serious
doubts. Happily for us, there is nothing of this kind in the
geological history of the earth; as there is manifestly nothing
of it in that which is revealed in Scripture.</p>

<p>In the Scripture narrative each act of creation prepares for the
others, and in its consequences extends to them all. The inspired
writer announces the introduction of each new part of creation,
and then leaves it without any reference to the various phases
which it assumed as the work advanced. In the grand general view
which he takes, the land and seas first made represent those of
all the following periods. So do the first plants, the first
invertebrate animals, the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. He thus assures us that, however long the periods
represented by days of creation, the system of nature was one
from the beginning. In like manner in the geological record each
of the successive conditions of the earth is related to those
which precede and those which follow, as part of a series. So
also a uniform plan of construction pervades organic nature, and
uniform laws the inorganic world in all periods. We can thus
include in one system of natural history all animals and plants,
fossil as well as recent, and can resolve all inorganic changes
into the operation of existing laws. The former of these facts is
in its nature so remarkable as almost to warrant the belief of
special design. Naturalists had arranged the existing animals and
plants, without any reference to fossil species, in kingdoms,
sub-kingdoms, classes, orders, families, and genera. Geological
research has added a vast number of species not now existing in a
living state; yet all these fossils can be inserted within the
limits of recognized groups. We do not require to add a new
kingdom, sub-kingdom, or class; but, on the contrary, all the
fossil genera and species go into the existing divisions, in such
a manner as to fill them up precisely where they are most
deficient, thus occupying what would otherwise be gaps in the
existing system of nature. The principal difficulty which they
occasion to the zoologist and botanist is that, by filling the
intervals between genera previously widely separated, they give
to the whole a degree of continuity which renders it more
difficult to decide where the boundaries separating the groups
should be placed.</p>

<p>We also find that the animals and plants of the earlier periods
often combined in one form powers and properties afterward
separated in distinct groups; thus in the earlier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
formations the sauroid fishes unite peculiarities afterward divided between the
fish and reptiles, constituting what Agassiz has called a
synthetic type. Again, the series of creatures in time accords
with the ranks which a study of their types of structure induces
the naturalist to assign them in his system; and also within each
of the great sub-kingdoms presents many points of accordance with
the progress of the embryonic development of the individual
animal. Nor is this contradictory to the statement that the
earlier representatives of types are often of high and perfect
organization, for the progress both in geological time and in the
life of the individual is so much one of specialization that an
immature animal often presents points of affinity to higher forms
that disappear in the adult. In connection with this, earlier
organic forms often appear to foreshadow and predict others that
are to succeed them in time, as the winged and marine reptiles of
the Mesozoic foreshadow the birds and cetaceans. Agassiz has
admirably illustrated these links of connection between the past
and the present in the essay on classification prefixed to his
"Contributions to the Natural History of America." In reference
to "prophetic" types, he says: "They appear now like a prophecy
in those earlier times of an order of things not possible with
the earlier combinations then prevailing in the animal kingdom,
but exhibiting in a later period in a striking manner the
antecedent consideration of every step in the gradation of
animals."</p>

<p>4. The periods into which geology divides the history of the
earth are different from those of Scripture, yet when properly
understood there is a marked correspondence. Geology refers only
to the fifth and sixth days of creation, or, at most, to these
with parts of the fourth and seventh, and it divides this portion
of the work into several eras, founded on alternations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
of rock formations and changes in organic remains. The nature of
geological evidence renders it probable that many apparently
well-marked breaks in the chain may result merely from deficiency
in the preserved remains; and consequently that what appear to
the geologist to be very distinct periods may in reality run
together. The only natural divisions that Scripture teaches us to
look for are those between the fifth and sixth days, and those
which within these days mark the introduction of new animal
forms, as, for instance, the great reptiles of the fifth day. We
have already seen that the beginning of the fifth day can be
referred almost with certainty to the Pal&aelig;ozoic period. The
beginning of the sixth day may with nearly equal certainty be
referred to that of the Tertiary era. The introduction of great
reptiles and birds in the fifth day synchronizes and corresponds
with the beginning of the Mesozoic period; and that of man at the
close of the sixth day with the commencement of the Modern era in
geology. These four great coincidences are so much more than we
could have expected, in records so very different in their nature
and origin, that we need not pause to search for others of a more
obscure character. It may be well to introduce here a tabular
view of this correspondence between the geological and Biblical
periods, extending it as far as either record can carry us, and
thus giving a complete general view of the origin and history of
the world as deduced from revelation and science. In comparing
this table with that on page 330, it will be observed that the
latter refers to the last half of the creative week only, the
earlier half being occupied with physical changes which, however
probable inferentially, are not within the scope of geological
observation.</p>

5. In both records the ocean gives birth to the first dry land,
and it is the sea that is first inhabited, yet both lead at least
to the suspicion that a state of igneous fluidity preceded the
primitive universal ocean. In Scripture the original prevalence
of the ocean is distinctly stated, and all geologists are agreed
that in the early fossiliferous periods the sea must have
prevailed much more extensively than at present. Scripture also
expressly states that the waters were the birthplace of the
earliest animals, and geology has as yet discovered in the whole
Silurian series no terrestrial animal, though marine creatures
are extremely abundant; and though air-breathing creatures are
found in the later Pal&aelig;ozoic, they are, with the exception of
insects, of that semi-amphibious character which is proper to
alluvial flats and the deltas of rivers. It is true that the
negative evidence collected by geology does not render it
altogether impossible that terrestrial animals, even mammals, may
have existed in the earliest periods; yet there are, as already
pointed out, some positive indications opposed to this. The
Scripture, however, commits itself to the statement that the
higher land animals did not exist so early, though it must be
observed that there is nothing in the Mosaic narrative adverse to
the existence of birds, insects, and reptiles in the earlier
Pal&aelig;ozoic periods. I have said that the Bible, which informs us
of a universal ocean preceding the existence of land, also gives
indications of a still earlier period of igneous fluidity or
gaseous expansion. Geology also and astronomy have their
reasonings and speculations as to the prevalence of such
conditions. Here, however, both records become dim and obscure,
though it is evident that both point in the same direction, and
combine those aqueous and igneous origins which in the last
century afforded so fertile ground of one-sided dispute.</p>

<p>6. Both records concur in maintaining what is usually termed the
doctrine of existing causes in geology. Scripture and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
geology alike show that since the beginning of the fifth day, or
Pal&aelig;ozoic period, the inorganic world has continued under the
dominion of the same causes that now regulate its changes and
processes. The sacred narrative gives no hint of any creative
interposition in this department after the fourth day; and
geology assures us that all the rocks with which it is acquainted
have been produced by the same causes that are now throwing down
detritus in the bottom of the waters, or bringing up volcanic
products from the interior of the earth. This grand
generalization, therefore, first worked out in modern times by
Sir Charles Lyell, from a laborious collection of the changes
occurring in the present state of the world, was, as a doctrine
of divine revelation, announced more than three thousand years
ago by the Hebrew lawgiver; not for scientific purposes, but as a
part of the theology of the Hebrew monotheism.</p>

<p>7. Both records agree in assuring us that death prevailed in the
world ever since animals were introduced. The punishment
threatened to Adam, and considerations connected with man's state
of innocence, have led to the belief that the Bible teaches that
the lower animals, as well as man, were exempt from death before
the fall. When, however, we find the great <i>tanninim</i>, or
crocodilian reptiles, created in the fifth day, and beasts of
prey on the sixth, we need entertain no doubt on the subject, in
so far as Scripture is concerned. The geological record is
equally explicit. Carnivorous creatures, with the most formidable
powers of destruction, have left their remains in all parts of
the geological series; and indeed, up to the introduction of man,
the carnivorous fishes, reptiles, and quadrupeds were the lords
and tyrants of the earth. There can be little doubt, however,
that the introduction of man was the beginning of a change in
this respect.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
A creature destitute of offensive weapons, and
subsisting on fruits, was to rule by the power of intellect. As
already hinted, it is probable that in Eden he was surrounded by
a group of inoffensive animals, and that those creatures which he
had cause to dread would have disappeared as he extended his
dominion. In this way the law of violent death and destruction
which prevailed under the dynasties of the fish, the reptile, and
the carnivorous mammifer would ultimately have been abrogated;
and under the milder sway of man life and peace would have
reigned in a manner to which our knowledge of pre-Adamite and
present nature may afford no adequate key. Be this as it may, on
the important point of the original prevalence of death among the
lower animals both records are at one.</p>

<p>8. In the department of "final causes," as they have been termed,
Scripture and geology unite in affording large and interesting
views. They illustrate the procedure of the All-wise Creator
during a long succession of ages, and thus enable us to see the
effects of any of his laws, not only at one time, but in far
distant periods. To reject the consideration of this peculiarity
of geological science would be the extremest folly, and would
involve at once a misinterpretation of the geologic record and a
denial of the agency of an intelligent Designer as revealed in
Scripture, and indicated by the succession of beings. Many of the
past changes of the earth acquire their full significance only
when taken in connection with the present wants of the earth's
inhabitants; and along the whole course of the geological history
the creatures that we meet with are equally rich in the evidences
of nice adaptation to circumstances and wonderful contrivances
for special ends, with their modern representatives. As an
example of the former, how wonderful is the connection of the
great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
vegetable accumulations of the ancient coal swamps, and
the bands and nodules of iron-stone which were separated from the
ferruginous sands or clays in their vicinity by the action of
this very vegetable matter, with the whole fabric of modern
civilization, and especially with the prosperity of that race
which, in our time, stands in the front of the world's progress.
In a very ancient period, wide swamps and deltas, teeming with
vegetable life, and which, if they now existed, would be but
pestilent breeders of miasmata, spread over large tracts of the
northern hemisphere, on which marine animals had previously
accumulated thick sheets of limestone. Vast beds of vegetable
matter were collected by growth in these swamps, and the waste
particles that passed off in the form of organic acids were
employed in concentrating the oxide of iron in underlying clays
and sands. In the lapse of ages the whole of these accumulations
were buried deep in the crust of the earth; and long periods
succeeded, when the earth was tenanted by reptilian and other
creatures, unconscious of the treasures beneath them. The modern
period arrived. The equable climate of the coal era had passed
away. Continents were prepared for the residence of man, and the
edges of the old carboniferous beds were exposed by subterranean
movements, and laid bare by denudation. Man was introduced, fell
from his state of innocence, and was condemned to earn his
subsistence by the sweat of his brow; and now for the first time
appears the use of these buried coal swamps. They now afford at
once the materials of improvement in the arts and of comfortable
subsistence in extreme climates, and subjects of surpassing
interest to the naturalist. Similar instances may be gleaned by
the natural theologian from nearly every part of the geological
history.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
Lastly. Both records represent man as the last of God's works,
and the culminating-point of the whole creation. We have already
had occasion to refer to this as a result of zoology, geology,
and Scriptural exegesis, and may here confine ourselves to the
moral consequences of this great truth. Man is the capital of the
column; and, if marred and defaced by moral evil, the symmetry of
the whole is to be restored, not by rejecting him altogether,
like the extinct species of the ancient world, and replacing him
by another, but by re-casting him in the image of his Divine
Redeemer. Man, though recently introduced, is to exist eternally.
He is, in one or another state of being, to be witness of all
future changes of the earth. He has before him the option of
being one with his Maker, and sharing in a future glorious and
finally renovated condition of our planet, or of sinking into
endless degradation. Such is the great spiritual drama of man's
fate to be acted out on the theatre of the world. Every human
being must play his part in it, and the present must decide what
that part shall be. The Bible bases these great foreshadowings of
the future on its own peculiar evidence; yet I may venture humbly
to maintain that its harmony with natural science, as far as the
latter can ascend, gives to the Word of God a pre-eminent claim
on the attention of the naturalist. The Bible, unlike every other
system of religious doctrine, fears no investigation or
discussion. It courts these. "While science," says a modern
divine,
<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
"is fatal to superstition, it is fortification to a
Scriptural faith. The Bible is the bravest of books. Coming from
God, and conscious of nothing but God's truth, it awaits the
progress of knowledge with calm security. It watches the
antiquary ransacking among classic ruins, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
rejoices in every medal he discovers and every inscription he deciphers; for from
that rusty coin or corroded marble it expects nothing but
confirmations of its own veracity. In the unlocking of an
Egyptian hieroglyphic or the unearthing of some implement it
hails the resurrection of so many witnesses; and with sparkling
elation it follows the botanist as he scales Mount Lebanon, or
the zoologist as he makes acquaintance with the beasts of the
Syrian desert; or the traveller as he stumbles on a long-lost
Petra or Nineveh or Babylon. And from the march of time it fears
no evil, but calmly abides the fulfilment of those prophecies and
the forthcoming of those events with whose predicted story
inspiration has already inscribed its page. It is not light but
darkness which the Bible deprecates; and if men of piety were
also men of science, and if men of science were to search the
Scriptures, there would be more faith in the earth, and also more
philosophy."</p>

<p>The reader has, I trust, found in the preceding pages sufficient
evidence that the Bible has nothing to dread from the revelations
of geology, but much to hope in the way of elucidation of its
meaning and confirmation of its truth. If convinced of this, I
trust that he will allow me now to ask for the warnings,
promises, and predictions of the Book of God his entire
confidence; and, in conclusion, to direct his attention to the
glorious prospects which it holds forth to the human race, and to
every individual of it who, in humility and self-renunciation,
casts himself in faith on that Divine Redeemer who is at once the
creator of the heavens and the earth, and the brother and the
friend of the penitent and the contrite. That same old book,
which carries back our view to those ancient conditions of our
planet which preceded not only the creation of man, but the
earliest periods of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
science has cognizance, likewise
carries our minds forward into the farthest depths of futurity,
and shows that all present things must pass away. It reveals to
us a new heaven and a new earth, which are to replace those now
existing; when the Eternal Son of God, the manifestation of the
Father equally in creation and redemption, shall come forth
conquering and to conquer, and shall sweep away into utter
extinction all the blood-stained tyrannies of the present earth,
even as he has swept away the brute dynasties of the pre-Adamite
world, and shall establish a reign of peace, of love, and of
holiness that shall never pass away: when the purified sons of
Adam, rejoicing in immortal youth and happiness, shall be able to
look back with enlarged understandings and grateful hearts on the
whole history of creation and redemption, and shall join their
angelic brethren in the final and more ecstatic repetition of
that hymn of praise with which the heavenly hosts greeted the
birth of our planet. May God in his mercy grant that he who
writes and they who read may "stand in their lot at the end of
the days" and enjoy the full fruition of these glorious
prospects.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.<br /><br />

<span style="font-size:70%;">A.&mdash;TRUE AND FALSE EVOLUTION.</span></h2>

<p>
The term "evolution" need not in itself be a bugbear on
theological grounds. The Bible writers would, I presume, have no
objection to it if understood to mean the development of the
plans of the Creator in nature. That kind of evolution to which
they would object, and to which enlightened reason also objects,
is the spontaneous evolution of nothing into atoms and force, and
of these into all the wonderful and complicated plan of nature,
without any guiding mind. Farther, biological and pal&aelig;ontological
science, as well as the Bible, object to the derivation of living
things from dead matter by merely natural means, because this can
not be proved to be possible, and to the production of the series
of organic forms found as fossils in the rocks of the earth by
the process of struggle for existence and survival of the
fittest, because this does not suffice to account for the complex
phenomena presented by this succession. With reference to the
testimony of pal&aelig;ontology, I have in other publications developed
this very fully; and would here merely quote the summing up of
the argument, as given in my Address of 1875 before the American
Association for the Advancement of Science:</p>

<p>"I have thus far said nothing of the bearing of the prevalent
ideas of descent with modification on this wonderful procession
of life. None of these of course can be expected to take us back
to the origin of living beings; but they also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
fail to explain why so vast numbers of highly organized species struggle into
existence simultaneously in one age and disappear in another; why
no continuous chain of succession in time can be found gradually
blending species into each other; and why in the natural
succession of things degradation under the influence of external
conditions and final extinction seem to be laws of organic
existence. It is useless here to appeal to the imperfection of
the record or to the movements or migrations of species. The
record is now in many important parts too complete, and the
simultaneousness of the entrance of the faunas and floras too
certainly established, and moving species from place to place
only evades the difficulty. The truth is that such hypotheses are
at present premature, and that we require to have larger
collections of facts. Independently of this, however, it appears
to me that from a philosophical point of view it is extremely
probable that all theories of evolution as at present applied to
life are fundamentally defective in being too partial in their
character; and perhaps I can not better group the remainder of
the facts to which I wish to refer than by using them to
illustrate this feature of most of the later attempts at
generalization on this subject.</p>

<p>"First, then, these hypotheses are too partial in their tendency
to refer numerous and complex phenomena to one cause, or to a few
causes only, when all trustworthy analogy would indicate that
they must result from many concurrent forces and determinations
of force. We have all no doubt read those ingenious, not to say
amusing, speculations in which some entomologists and botanists
have indulged with reference to the mutual relations of flowers
and haustellate insects. Geologically the facts oblige us to
begin with cryptogamous plants and mandibulate insects, and out
of the desire of insects for non-existent honey, and the
adaptations of plants to the requirements of non-existent
suctorial apparatus, we have to evolve the marvellous complexity
of floral form
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
and coloring, and the exquisitely delicate
apparatus of the mouths of haustellate insects. Now when it is
borne in mind that this theory implies a mental confusion on our
part precisely similar to that which in the department of
mechanics actuates the seekers for perpetual motion, that we have
not the smallest tittle of evidence that the changes required
have actually occurred in any one case, and that the thousands of
other structures and relations of the plant and the insect have
to be worked out by a series of concurrent evolutions so complex
and absolutely incalculable in the aggregate that the cycles and
epicycles of the Ptolemaic astronomy were child's play in
comparison, we need not wonder that the common-sense of mankind
revolts against such fancies, and that we are accused of
attempting to construct the universe by methods that would baffle
Omnipotence itself, because they are simply absurd. In this
aspect of them indeed such speculations are necessarily futile,
because no mind can grasp all the complexities of even any one
case, and it is useless to follow out an imaginary line of
development which unexplained facts must contradict at every
step. This is also no doubt the reason why all recent attempts at
constructing 'Phylogenies' are so changeable, and why no two
experts can agree about the details of any of them.</p>

<p>"A second aspect in which such speculations are too partial is in
the unwarranted use which they make of analogy. It is not unusual
to find such analogies as that between the embryonic development
of the individual animal and the succession of animals in
geological time placed on a level with that reasoning from
analogy by which geologists apply modern causes to explain
geological formations. No claim could be more unfounded. When the
geologist studies ancient limestones built up of the remains of
corals, and then applies the phenomena of modern coral reefs to
explain their origin, he brings the latter to bear on the former
by an analogy which includes not merely the apparent results, but
the causes at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
work, and the conditions of their action, and it
is on this that the validity of his comparison depends, in so far
as it relates to similarity of mode of formation. But when we
compare the development of an animal from an embryo cell with the
progress of animals in time, though we have a curious analogy as
to the steps of the process, the conditions and causes at work
are known to be altogether dissimilar, and therefore we have no
evidence whatever as to identity of cause, and our reasoning
becomes at once the most transparent of fallacies. Farther, we
have no right here to overlook the fact that the conditions of
the embryo are determined by those of a previous adult, and that
no sooner does this hereditary potentiality produce a new adult
animal than the terrible external agencies of the physical world,
in presence of which all life exists, begin to tell on the
organism, and after a struggle of longer or shorter duration it
succumbs to death, and its substance returns into inorganic
nature&mdash;a law from which even the longer life of the species does
not seem to exempt it. All this is so plain and manifest that it
is extraordinary that evolutionists will continue to use such
partial and imperfect arguments. Another example may be taken
from that application of the doctrine of natural selection to
explain the introduction of species in geological time, which is
so elaborately discussed by Sir C. Lyell in the last edition of
his 'Principles of Geology.' The great geologist evidently leans
strongly to the theory, and claims for it the 'highest degree of
probability;' yet he perceives that there is a serious gap in it,
since no modern fact has ever proved the origin of a new species
by modification. Such a gap, if it existed in those grand
analogies by which we explain geological formations through
modern causes, would be admitted to be fatal.</p>

<p>"A third illustration of the partial character of these
hypotheses may be taken from the use made of the theory deduced
from modern physical discoveries, that life must be merely a
product of the continuous operation of physical laws. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
assumption, for it is nothing more, that the phenomena of life
are produced merely by some arrangement of physical forces, even
if it be admitted to be true, gives only a partial explanation of
the possible origin of life. It does not account for the fact
that life as a force or combination of forces is set in
antagonism to all other forces. It does not account for the
marvellous connection of life with organization. It does not
account for the determination and arrangement of forces implied
in life. A very simple illustration may make this plain. If the
problem to be solved were the origin of the mariner's compass,
one might assert that it is wholly a physical arrangement both as
to matter and force. Another might assert that it involves mind
and intelligence in addition. In some sense both would be right.
The properties of magnetic force and of iron or steel are purely
physical, and it might even be within the bounds of possibility
that somewhere in the universe a mass of natural loadstone may
have been so balanced as to swing in harmony with the earth's
magnetism. Yet we would surely be regarded as very credulous if
we could be induced to believe that the mariner's compass has
originated in that way. This argument applies with a thousandfold
greater force to the origin of life, which involves even in its
simplest forms so many more adjustments of force and so much more
complex machinery.</p>

<p>"Fourthly, these hypotheses are partial, inasmuch as they fail to
account for the vastly varied and correlated interdependencies of
natural things and forces, and for the unity of plan which
pervades the whole. These can be explained only by taking into
the account another element from without. Even when it professes
to admit the existence of a God, the evolutionist reasoning of
our day contents itself altogether with the physical or visible
universe, and leaves entirely out of sight the power of the
unseen and spiritual, as if this were something with which
science has nothing to do, but which belongs only to imagination
or sentiment. So much has this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
been the case, that when recently
a few physicists and naturalists have turned to this aspect of
the case, they have seemed to be teaching new and startling
truths, though only reviving some of the oldest and most
permanent ideas of our race. From the dawn of human thought it
has been the conclusion alike of philosophers, theologians, and
the common-sense of mankind that the seen can be explained only
by reference to the unseen, and that any merely physical theory
of the world is necessarily partial. This, too, is the position
of our sacred Scriptures, and is broadly stated in their opening
verse; and indeed it lies alike at the basis of all true religion
and all sound philosophy, for it must necessarily be that 'the
things that are seen are temporal, the things that are unseen
eternal.' With reference to the primal aggregation of energy in
the visible universe, with reference to the introduction of life,
with reference to the soul of man, with reference to the heavenly
gifts of genius and prophecy, with reference to the introduction
of the Saviour himself into the world, and with reference to the
spiritual gifts and graces of God's people&mdash;all these spring not
from sporadic acts of intervention, but from the continuous
action of God and the unseen world, and this we must never forget
is the true ideal of creation in Scripture and in sound theology.
Only in such exceptional and little influential philosophies as
that of Democritus, and in the speculations of a few men carried
off their balance by the brilliant physical discoveries of our
age, has this necessarily partial and imperfect view been
adopted. Never, indeed, was its imperfection more clear than in
the light of modern science.</p>

<p>"Geology, by tracing back all present things to their origin, was
the first science to establish on a basis of observed facts the
necessity of a beginning and end of the world. But even physical
science now teaches us that the visible world is a vast machine
for the dissipation of energy; that the processes going on in it
must have had a beginning in time, and that all things tend to a
final and helpless equilibrium. This necessity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
implies an unseen power, an invisible universe, in which the visible universe must
have originated, and to which its energy is ever returning. The
hiatus between the seen and the unseen may be bridged over by the
conceptions of atomic vortices of force, and by the universal and
continuous ether; but whether or not, it has become clear that
the conception of the unseen as existing has become necessary to
our belief in the possible existence of the physical universe
itself, even without taking life into the account.</p>

<p>"It is in the domain of life, however, that this necessity
becomes most apparent; and it is in the plant that we first
clearly perceive a visible testimony to that unseen which is the
counterpart of the seen. Life in the plant opposes the outward
rush of force in our system, arrests a part of it on its way,
fixes it as potential energy, and thus, forming a mere eddy, so
to speak, in the process of dissipation of energy, it accumulates
that on which animal life and man himself may subsist, and
asserts for a time supremacy over the seen and temporal on behalf
of the unseen and eternal. I say for a time, because life is, in
the visible universe, as at present constituted, but a temporary
exception, introduced from that unseen world where it is no
longer the exception, but the eternal rule. In a still higher
sense, then, than that in which matter and force testify to a
Creator, organization and life, whether in the plant, the animal,
or man, bear the same testimony, and exist as outposts put forth
in the succession of ages from that higher heaven that surrounds
the visible universe. In them, too, Almighty power is no doubt
conditioned or limited by law, yet they bear more distinctly upon
them the impress of their Maker; and, while all explanations of
the physical universe which refuse to recognize its spiritual and
unseen origin must necessarily be partial and in the end
incomprehensible, this destiny falls more quickly and surely on
the attempt to account for life and its succession on merely
materialistic principles.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
"Here again, however, I must remind you that creation, as
maintained against such materialistic evolution, whether by
theology, philosophy, or Holy Scripture, is necessarily a
continuous, nay, an eternal influence, not an intervention of
disconnected acts. It is the true continuity, which includes and
binds together all other continuity.</p>

<p>"It is here that natural science meets with theology, not as an
antagonist, but as a friend and ally in its time of greatest
need; and I must here record my belief that neither men of
science nor theologians have a right to separate what God in Holy
Scripture has joined together, or to build up a wall between
nature and religion, and write upon it 'no thoroughfare.' The
science that does this must be impotent to explain nature, and
without hold on the higher sentiments of man. The theology that
does this must sink into mere superstition.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, can we formulate a few of the general laws, or
perhaps I had better call them general conclusions, respecting
life, in which all pal&aelig;ontologists may agree? Perhaps it is not
possible to do this at present satisfactorily, but the attempt
may do no harm. We may, then, I think, make the following
affirmations:</p>

<p>"1. The existence of life and organization on the earth is not
eternal, nor even coeval with the beginning of the physical
universe, but may possibly date from Laurentian or immediately
pre-Laurentian times.</p>

<p>"2. The introduction of new species of animals and plants has
been a continuous process, not necessarily in the sense of
derivation of one species from another, but in the higher sense
of the continued operation of the cause or causes which
introduced life at first. This, as already stated, I take to be
the true theological or Scriptural as well as scientific idea of
what we ordinarily and somewhat loosely term creation.</p>

<p>"3. Though thus continuous, the process has not been uniform; but
periods of rapid production of species have alternated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
with others in which many disappeared and few were introduced. This
may have been an effect of physical cycles reacting on the
progress of life.</p>

<p>"4. Species, like individuals, have greater energy and vitality
in their younger stages, and rapidly assume all their varietal
forms, and extend themselves as widely as external circumstances
will permit. Like individuals also, they have their periods of
old age and decay, though the life of some species has been of
enormous duration in comparison with that of others; the
difference appearing to be connected with degrees of adaptation
to different conditions of life.</p>

<p>"5. Many allied species, constituting groups of animals and
plants, have made their appearance at once in various parts of
the earth, and these groups have obeyed the same laws with the
individual and the species in culminating rapidly, and then
slowly diminishing, though a large group once introduced has
rarely disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>"6. Groups of species, as genera and orders, do not usually begin
with their highest or lowest forms, but with intermediate and
generalized types, and they show a capacity for both elevation
and degradation in their subsequent history.</p>

<p>"7. The history of life presents a progress from the lower to the
higher, and from the simpler to the more complex, and from the
more generalized to the more specialized. In this progress new
types are introduced and take the place of the older ones, which
sink to a relatively subordinate place and become thus degraded.
But the physical and organic changes have been so correlated and
adjusted that life has not only always maintained its existence,
but has been enabled to assume more complex forms, and that older
forms have been made to prepare the way for newer, so that there
has been on the whole a steady elevation culminating in man
himself. Elevation and specialization have, however, been secured
at the expense of vital energy and range of adaptation, until
the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
new element of a rational and inventive nature was
introduced in the case of man.</p>

<p>"8. In regard to the larger and more distinct types, we can not
find evidence that they have, in their introduction, been
preceded by similar forms connecting them with previous groups;
but there is reason to believe that many supposed representative
species in successive formations are really only races or
varieties.</p>

<p>"9. In so far as we can trace their history, specific types are
permanent in their characters from their introduction to their
extinction, and their earlier varietal forms are similar to their
later ones.</p>

<p>"10. Pal&aelig;ontology furnishes no direct evidence, perhaps never can
furnish any, as to the actual transformation of one species into
another, or as to the actual circumstances of creation of a
species, but the drift of its testimony is to show that species
come in <i>per saltum</i>, rather than by any slow and gradual
process.</p>

<p>"11. The origin and history of life can not, any more than the
origin and determination of matter and force, be explained on
purely material grounds, but involve the consideration of power
referable to the unseen and spiritual world.</p>

<p>"Different minds may state these principles in different ways,
but I believe that, in so far as pal&aelig;ontology is concerned, in
substance they must hold good, at least as steps to higher
truths."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">B.&mdash;EVOLUTION AND CREATION BY LAW.</span></h2>

<p>Evolutionist writers have a great horror of what they term
"intervention." But they should be informed that the idea of a
planning Creator does not involve intervention in an
extraordinary or miraculous sense, any more than what we call the
ordinary operations of nature. It is a common but childish
prejudice that every discovery of a secondary cause diminishes so
much of what is to be referred to the agency of God. On the
contrary, such discoveries merely aid us in comprehending the
manner of his action. But when evolutionists, in their zeal to
get rid of creative intervention, trace all things to the
interaction of insensate causes, they fall into the absurdity of
believing in absolute unmitigated chance as the cause of perfect
order. Evidences of this may be found by the score in Darwin's
works on the origin of species. I quote, however, from another
and usually clear thinker, Wallace, in a review of the Duke of
Argyll's "Reign of Law," which appeared some years ago, but
represents very well this phase of thought:</p>

<p>"'It is curious,' says the Duke of Argyll, 'to observe the
language which this most advanced disciple of pure naturalism
[Mr. Darwin] instinctively uses, when he has to describe the
complicated structure of this curious order of plants [the
Orchids]. Caution in ascribing intentions to nature does not seem
to occur to him as possible. Intention is the one thing which he
does see, and which, when he does not see, he seeks for
diligently until he finds it. He exhausts every form of words and
of illustration by which intention or mental purpose can be
described. 'Contrivance'&mdash;'curious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
contrivance'&mdash;'beautiful contrivance'&mdash;these are expressions which occur over and over
again. Here is one sentence describing the parts of a particular
species: 'the labellum is developed into a long nectary, <i>in
order</i> to attract lepidoptera, and we shall presently give reason
for suspecting that the nectar is <i>purposely</i> so lodged that it
can be sucked only slowly, <i>in order</i> to give time for the
curious chemical quality of this viscid matter setting hard and
dry.'" Many other examples of similar expressions are quoted by
the duke, who maintains that no explanation of these
"contrivances" has been or can be given, except on the
supposition of a personal contriver, specially arranging the
details of each case, although causing them to be produced by the
ordinary processes of growth and reproduction.</p>

<p>"Now there is a difficulty in this view of the origin of the
structure of orchids which the duke does not allude to. The
majority of flowering plants are fertilized, either without the
agency of insects, or, when insects are required, without any
very important modification of the structure of the flower. It is
evident, therefore, that flowers might have been formed as
varied, fantastic, and beautiful as the orchids, and yet have
been fertilized by insects in the same manner as violets or
clover or primroses, or a thousand other flowers. The strange
springs and traps and pitfalls found in the flowers of orchids
can not be necessary <i>per se</i>, since exactly the same end is
gained in ten thousand other flowers which do not possess them.
Is it not, then, an extraordinary idea to imagine the Creator of
the universe <i>contriving</i> the various complicated parts of these
flowers as a mechanic might contrive an ingenious toy or a
difficult puzzle? Is it not a more worthy conception that they
are some of the results of those general laws which were so
co-ordinated at the first introduction of life upon the earth as
to result necessarily in the utmost possible development of
varied forms?"</p>

<p>A moment's thought is sufficient to show that there is no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
essential difference between the Creator contriving every detail
of the structure of an orchid and his producing it through some
intermediate cause, or his commanding it into existence by his
almighty word. The same mental process, so to speak, of the
contriver is implied in either case. But there is an immeasurable
difference between any of those ideas and that of the orchid
producing its parts spontaneously under the operation of
insensate physical law, whatever that may be, alone. Again, in
the same review, Wallace writes:</p>

<p>"The uncertainty of opinion among naturalists as to which are
species and which varieties is one of Mr. Darwin's very strong
arguments that these two names can not belong to things quite
distinct in nature and origin. The reviewer says that this
argument is of no weight, because the works of man present
exactly the same phenomena, and he instances patent inventions,
and the excessive difficulty of determining whether they are new
or old. I accept the analogy, and maintain that it is all in
favor of Mr. Darwin's views; for are not all inventions of the
same kind directly affiliated to a common ancestor. Are not
improved steam-engines or clocks the lineal descendants of some
existing steam-engine or clock? Is there ever a new creation in
art or science any more than in nature? Did ever patentee
absolutely originate any complete and entire invention no portion
of which was derived from any thing that had been made or
described before? It is, therefore, clear that the difficulty of
distinguishing the various classes of inventions which claim to
be new is of the same nature as the difficulty of distinguishing
varieties and species, because neither are absolute new
creations, but both are alike descendants of pre-existing forms,
from which and from each other they differ by varying and often
imperceptible degrees. It appears, then, that however plausible
this writer's objections may seem, whenever he descends from
generalities to any specific statement his supposed difficulties
turn out to be in reality strongly confirmatory of Mr. Darwin's
view."</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Now that improved steam-engines are lineal descendants of other
steam-engines is absolute nonsense, in any other aspect than that
the structure of one suggested the structure of another to a
contriving mind. We need not affirm this of God; but we may
affirm that the plans of the creative mind constitute the true
link of connection between the different states and developments
of inorganic and organic objects. This is the real meaning of
creation by law, as distinguished from mere chance on the one
hand, and arbitrary and capricious intervention on the other.
Both of these extremes are equally illogical; and it can not be
too frequently repeated that divine revelation avoids both by
maintaining with equal firmness the agency of the Creator, and
that agency not capricious, but according to plan and purpose;
embracing not merely the action of the divine mind itself, but
under it of all the forces and material things created.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">C.&mdash;MODES OF CREATION.</span></h2>

<p>A question often asked, but not easily answered, with reference
to the creation of animals and plants, is&mdash;What was its precise
method, and to what extent is such intervention conceivable. This
is, it is true, not a properly scientific question, since science
can not inform us of the act of creation. Nor is it properly a
theological one, since revelation appeals to our faith in the
facts, without giving us much information as to the mode. It can,
therefore, be answered only conjecturally, except in so far as
the law or plan of creation can be inferred from what is known,
either from science or revelation, as to the history of life.</p>

<p>We may, in the first place, assume that law or plan must
characterize creation. The Scriptural idea of it is not
reconcilable with the supposition of a series of arbitrary acts
any more than the scientific idea. The nature of these laws, as
disclosed by Pal&aelig;ontology, has been already considered in a
preceding part of this Appendix. What we may conjecture as to the
nature of the creative act itself, from a comparison of nature
and revelation, may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p>1. If we reduce organized beings to their ultimate
organisms&mdash;cells or plastids&mdash;and with Spencer and Haeckel
suppose these to be farther divisible into still smaller
particles or plastidules, each composed of several complex
particles of albumen or protoplasm, we may suppose the primary
act of creation to consist in the aggregation of molecules of
albuminous matter into such plastidules bearing the same
relations, as "manufactured articles," to the future cell that
inorganic molecules bear to crystals, and possessing within
themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the potencies of organic forms. This is the nearest
approach that we can make to the primary creative act, and its
scientific basis is merely hypothetical, while revelation gives
us no intimation as to any such constitution of organized matter.</p>

<p>2. The formul&aelig; in Genesis, "Let the land produce," and "Let the
waters produce," imply some sort of mediate creation through the
agency of the land and the waters, but of what sort we have no
means of knowing. They include, however, the idea of the origin
of the lower and humbler forms of life from material pre-existing
in inorganic nature, and also the idea of the previous
preparation of the land and the waters for the sustenance of the
creatures produced.</p>

<p>3. The expression in the case of man&mdash;"out of the dust"&mdash;would
seem to intimate that the human body was constituted of merely
elementary matter, without any previous preparation in organic
forms. It may, however, be intended merely to inform us that,
while the spirit is in the image of God, the bodily frame is "of
the earth earthy," and in no respect different in general nature
from that of the inferior animals.</p>

<p>4. The Bible indicates some ways in which creatures may be
modified or changed into new species, or may give rise to new
forms of life. The human body is, we are told, capable of
transformation into a new or spiritual body, different in many
important respects, and the future general prevalence of this
change is an article of religious faith. The Bible represents the
woman as produced from the man by a species of fission, not known
to us as a natural possibility, except in some of the lower forms
of life. The birth of the Saviour is represented as having been
by parthenogenesis, and if it had pleased God that Jesus was to
remain on earth as the progenitor of a new and higher type of man
to replace that now existing, this might be regarded as the
introduction of a new species. To what extent the Creator may
have so acted on the constitution of organized beings as to
produce changes of this kind we have no means of knowing; but if
he have done so, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
may be sure that it has been in accordance
with some definite plan or law.</p>

<p>5. We have a right to infer from Scripture that there must be
some creative law which provides for the introduction of species,
<i>de novo</i>, from unorganized matter, and which has been or is
called into action by conditions as yet altogether unknown to us,
and as yet inimitable, and therefore in some sense miraculous.
Whether we shall ever by scientific investigation discover the
law of this kind of divine intervention it is impossible to say.
That all the theories of spontaneous generation and derivation
hitherto promulgated are but wild guesses at it is but too
evident.</p>

<p>6. Since in inorganic nature we meet with such ultimate facts as
atoms of different kinds and with different properties; and ether
of non-atomic constitution, all of which seem to be necessary to
the existence of the world as it is, we may expect in like manner
to find at the basis of organic structures and phenomena varied
kinds of ultimate organisms and forces, probably much more
complicated than those of inorganic nature. The broad simplicity
of existing theories of derivation and evolution is thus in
itself a presumption against their truth, except as very partial
explanations.</p>

<p>7. We have no right to consider the species "after their kinds"
of revelation as coincident with the species recognized by
science. Many of these may be merely races, the production of
which in the course of time and in special circumstances may fall
within the powers of created species, and which may merely be the
phases of such species in time and place. Only the accumulation
of vast additional stores of facts can enable us to have any
certain opinion on this point, and till it is settled the
doctrine of derivation must remain purely hypothetical.</p>

<p>8. The inference of evolutionists that because certain forms of
life succeed each other in geological time, they must have been
derived from each other, has an aspect of truth and simplicity;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
but the idea of law or plan in creation suggests that the link of
connection may be of a less direct nature than mere descent with
modification. This has been referred to under a previous head.</p>

<p>9. In the scheme of revelation all the successions and changes of
organized beings, just as much as their introduction at first,
belong to the will and plan of God. Revelation opposes no
obstacle to any scientific investigation of the nature and method
of this plan, nor does it contemplate the idea that any
discoveries of this kind in any way isolate the Creator from his
works. Farther, inasmuch as God is always present in all his
works, one part of his procedure can scarcely be considered an
"intervention" any more than another.</p>

<p>10. As an illustration of the hypothetical condition of this
subject, and of the views which may be taken as to its details, I
quote from a memoir of my own certain conclusions with reference
to the origin of the species of land plants which are found in
the older geological formations. The conclusions stated are at
the end of a detailed consideration of these plants and the
circumstances of their occurrence:</p>

<p>"(1.) Some of the forms reckoned as specific in the Devonian and
Carboniferous formations may be really derivative races. There
are indications that such races may have originated in one or
more of the following ways: (<i>a</i>) By a natural tendency in
synthetic types to become specialized in the direction of one or
other of their constituent elements. In this way such plants as
<i>Arthrostigma</i> and <i>Psilophyton</i> may have assumed new varietal
forms. (<i>b</i>) By embryonic retardation or acceleration,
<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
whereby certain species may have had their maturity advanced or
postponed, thus giving them various grades of perfection in
reproduction and complexity of structure. The fact that so many
Erian and Carboniferous plants seem to be on the confines of the
groups of Acrogens
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
and Gymnosperms may be supposed favorable to
such exchanges. (<i>c</i>) The contraction and breaking up of floras
which occurred in the Middle Erian and Lower Carboniferous may
have been eminently favorable to the production of such varietal
forms as would result from what has been called the 'struggle for
existence.' (<i>d</i>) The elevation of a great expanse of new land at
the close of the Middle Erian and the beginning of the Coal
period would, by permitting the extension of series over wide
areas and fertile soils, and by removing the pressure previously
existing, be eminently favorable to the production of new, and
especially of improved, varieties.</p>

<p>"(2.) Whatever importance we may attach to the above supposed
causes of change, we still require to account for the origin of
our specific types. This may forever elude our observation, but
we may at least hope to ascertain the external conditions
favorable to their production. In order to attain even to this it
will be necessary to inquire critically, with reference to every
acknowledged species, what its claims to distinctness are, so
that we may be enabled to distinguish specific types from mere
varieties. Having attained to some certainty in this, we may be
prepared to inquire whether the conditions favorable to the
appearance of new varieties were also those favorable to the
creation of new types, or the reverse&mdash;whether these conditions
were those of compression or expansion, or to what extent the
appearance of new types may be independent of any external
conditions, other than those absolutely necessary for their
existence. I am not without hope that the further study of fossil
plants may enable us thus to approach to a comprehension of the
laws of the creation, as distinguished from those of the
continued existence of species.</p>

<p>"In the present state of our knowledge we have no good ground
either to limit the number of specific types beyond what a fair
study of our material may warrant, or to infer that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
such primitive types must necessarily have been of low grade, or that
progress in varietal forms has always been upward. The occurrence
of such an advanced and specialized type as that of
<i>Syringoxylon</i> in the Middle Devonian should guard us against
these errors. The creative process may have been applicable to
the highest as well as to the lowest forms, and subsequent
deviations must have included degradation as well as elevation. I
can conceive nothing more unreasonable than the statement
sometimes made that it is illogical or even absurd to suppose
that highly organized beings could have been produced except by
derivation from previously existing organisms. This is begging
the whole question at issue, depriving science of a noble
department of inquiry on which it has as yet barely entered, and
anticipating by unwarranted assertions conclusions which may
perhaps suddenly dawn upon us through the inspiration of some
great intellect, or may for generations to come baffle the united
exertions of all the earnest promoters of natural science. Our
present attitude should not be that of dogmatists, but that of
patient workers content to labor for a harvest of grand
generalizations which may not come till we have passed away, but
which, if we are earnest and true to nature and its Creator, may
reward even some of us."

<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">D.&mdash;PRESENT CONDITION OF THEORIES OF LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>One of the most learned and ingenious essays on this subject
recently published
<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
states on its first page that all the
varieties of opinion may be summed up under two heads:</p>

<p>"1. Those which require the addition to ordinary matter of an
immaterial or spiritual essence, substance, or power, general or
local, whose presence is the efficient cause of life; and,</p>

<p>"2. Those which attribute the phenomena of life solely to the
mode of combination of the ordinary material elements of which
the organism is composed, without the addition of any such
immaterial essence, power, or force."</p>

<p>It is quite true that physiologists have up to this time argued
out these two alternatives, and that at present the second is
probably the more prevalent. It is however also true that neither
includes or can possibly include the whole truth, and that
enlightened theism may enable us to hold both, or all that is
true in either. Undoubtedly we must hold that a higher spiritual
power or Creator is necessary to the existence of life; but then
this is necessary also to the existence of dead matter and force.
So that if physiologists think proper to trace the whole
phenomena of life to material causes, they do not on that account
in any way invalidate the evidence for a spiritual Creator, nor
for a spiritual element in the higher nature of man. Yet so
inconceivably shallow is much of the biological reasoning of the
day, that it is quite common to find physiologists referring all
life to spontaneous and uncaused material agencies, because they
have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
concluded that the arrangements of matter and force are
sufficient to explain it; and, on the other hand, to find
theistic writers accusing physiology of materialism, if it finds
the causes of vital phenomena in material forces, as if God could
be present only in those processes which we can not understand.</p>

<p>What we really know as to the material basis of life may be
summed up in a few words. Chemically, life is based on compounds
of the albuminous group. These are highly complex in a molecular
point of view, and seem to be formed in nature only where certain
structures, those of the vegetable cell, exist under certain
conditions. These albuminous substances do not necessarily
possess vital properties. They may exist in a dead state just as
other substances. Under certain conditions, however, those of
forming part of a so-called living organism, they present
phenomena of mechanical movement and molecular change, and of
transformation or transmission of force, which enable them to
transform themselves into various kinds of tissues, to nourish
these when formed, and to establish a consensus of action between
different parts of the organism; and these properties are vastly
varied in detail according to the kind of organism in which they
take place, and the conditions under which the organism exists.
The actually living matter presents no distinct structure
recognizable by the microscope, and can not be distinguished
chemically from ordinary albumen or protoplasm; but when living
it must either exist in some peculiar and complex molecular
arrangement unknown as yet to chemistry and physics, or must be
actuated by some force or form of force called vital, and not as
yet isolated or reduced to known laws or correlation. It does not
concern theism or theology which of these may eventually prove to
be the true view, or if it should be found, which is quite
possible, that there is no real difference between them. In any
case it is certain that in the lower animals, and in the merely
physiological properties
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
of man himself, living matter may act
independently of any higher spiritual nature in the individual,
though of course not independently of the higher power of God,
which gave matter its properties and sustains them in their
action. It is farther certain that in man the spiritual nature
dominates and controls the vital, except when under abnormal
conditions the latter unduly gains the mastery, and quenches
altogether the spirit. In the language of the Bible, the merely
vital endowments of the man belong to the flesh ([Greek: sarx]),
and to the rational mind or soul ([Greek: psych&ecirc;]). The higher
nature which man derives directly from God is the spirit ([Greek:
pneuma]). Either of these parts of the complex humanity is
capable of life ([Greek: z&ocirc;&ecirc;]) and of immortality. Either of them
is capable of being in a state of death, though the import of
this differs in its application to each. In Genesis, the body is
composed of the ordinary earth-materials&mdash;the "dust of the
ground." The higher nature is seen in the "shadow and likeness of
God," and in the inbreathing of the Divine Spirit whereby man
became a "living soul" in a higher sense than that in which the
animals possess the ordinary "breath of life." With these views
agree the later doctrines of the Bible as to the "trichotomy" of
"body, soul, and spirit" in man, and of the added influence of
the Spirit of God as acting on humanity.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">E.&mdash;RECENT FACTS AS TO THE ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF MAN.</span></h2>

<p>Several recent statements as to new facts supposed to prove a
preglacial antiquity for our species have been promulgated in
scientific journals; but so great doubt rests upon them that they
do not invalidate the statement that the earliest human remains
belong to the postglacial age. I may refer to the following:</p>

<p>A very remarkable discovery was made in 1875 by Professor
Rutimeyer, of Basle. In a brown coal deposit of Tertiary, or at
least of "interglacial" age&mdash;whatever that may mean in
Switzerland&mdash;he found some fragments of wood so interlaced as to
resemble wattle or basket-work. Steenstrup has, however,
re-examined the evidence, and adduces strong reasons for the
conclusion that the alleged human workmanship is really that of
beavers.</p>

<p>The Swedish geologists have shown that there is no properly
Pal&aelig;olithic age in Scandinavia, and that even the reindeer had
probably disappeared from Denmark and Sweden before their
occupation by man. Some facts, however, seemed to indicate a
residence of man in Sweden before the great post-pliocene
subsidence. One of the most important of these is the celebrated
hut of Sodertelge, referred to in this connection by Lyell.
Recent observations have, however, shown that this hut was really
covered by a landslip, and that its age may not be greater than
eight centuries. Torel has recently explained this in the
Proceedings of the Arch&aelig;ological Congress of Stockholm.</p>

<p>The human bone found in the Victoria Cave at Settle, apparently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
under a patch of boulder-clay, has been regarded as a good
evidence of the preglacial origin of man. It has, however,
always appeared to readers of the description as a very doubtful
case; and Professor Hughes, of Cambridge, has recently expressed
the opinion that the drift covering the bone may be merely a
"pocket" of that material disengaged from a cavity in the
limestone by the wearing of the cliff.</p>

<p>The same geologist has also shown reason to believe that the
supposed case of the occurrence of pal&aelig;olithic implements under
boulder-clay near Brandon, discovered by Mr. Skertchley, and
paraded by Geikie as a demonstration of the "interglacial"
antiquity of man, in accordance with his system of successive
glacial periods, is really an error, and has no foundation in the
facts of the case.</p>

<p>Mr. Pengelly has endeavored to maintain the value of the deposit
of stalagmite as a means of establishing dates, in his "Notes of
Recent Notices of the Geology of Devonshire," Part I., 1874; but,
I confess, with little success. He urges, in opposition to the
Ingleborough Cave, that at Cheddar, where, according to him, no
appreciable deposit whatever is taking place on the existing
stalagmite. But this, of course, is evidence not applicable to
the case in hand, as in the Cheddar case no stalagmite crust
whatever would be produced. There are, no doubt, crevices and
caves in which old stalagmite is even being removed or diminished
in thickness. He farther asserts that in Kent's Cave teeth of the
cave bear and other extinct animals are found covered by not more
than an inch and a half of stalagmite, and consequently that if
this were deposited at the rate of a quarter of an inch per
annum&mdash;the supposed rate on the "Jockey Cap" at
Ingleborough&mdash;these animals must have lived in Devonshire only
six years ago, which is, of course, absurd. But he fails to
perceive that this mode of occurrence is quite intelligible on
the supposition of a rapid decrease in the amount of deposition
in the later part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
of the stalagmite period. He farther refers to
the fact that the thicker masses of stalagmite, which correspond
to the places of more active drip of water, are in the same
position in both crusts of stalagmite. This shows that the
sources of water containing bicarbonate of lime have been the
same from the first; but it proves nothing as to the rate of
deposit.</p>

<p>Mr. Pengelly's own estimate of the rate of deposit gives,
however, a length of time which is sufficient to show that there
must be error somewhere in his calculations. He states the
aggregate thickness of the two crusts at twelve feet, and then,
assuming a rate of deposit of 0.05 inch in 250 years, or one inch
in 5000 years, he arrives at the conclusion that the whole
deposit required 720,000 years for its formation. He is "willing
to suppose" the mechanical deposits to have accumulated more
rapidly; but allowing one fourth of the time for them, we have
nearly a million of years claimed for the residence of man in
Devonshire, which, independently of other considerations, would
push back the Pal&aelig;ozoic trilobites and corals of that county into
the primitive reign of fire, and which in point of fact amounts
to a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the whole argument.</p>

<p>Professor Hughes
<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
refers, as a case of rapid deposition of
matter akin to stalagmite, to the deposit of travertine in the
old Roman aqueduct of the Pont du Gard, near Avignon, where a
thickness of fourteen inches seems to have accumulated in about
800 years. Mr. J. Carey has given in <i>Nature</i>, December 18, 1873,
another instance where a deposit 0.75 inch thick was formed in
fifteen years in a lead mine in Durham. Mr. W. B. Clarke in the
same journal gives a case where in a cave at Brixton, known as
Poole's Hole, a deposit one eighth of an inch in thickness was
formed in six months. Such examples show how unsafe it is to
reason as to the rate of deposit in by-gone times, and when
climatal and local conditions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
may have been very different from those at present subsisting.</p>

<p>In an able address before the biological section of the British
Association in 1876, Wallace adduces the following considerations
as bearing on these questions; and these are well worthy of
attention as showing that it is the necessities of evolution
rather than of geological facts that demand the assumption of a
great antiquity for man, and induce so many writers to accept any
evidence for this, however doubtful: (1) The great cerebral
development of the so-called Pal&aelig;olithic men, which shows no
indications of graduating into inferior races. (2) The great
variety of the implements of these ancient men, and the
excellence of their carvings on bone and ivory, point to a
similar conclusion. (3) Man is not related to any existing
species of ape, but in various ways to several different species.
(4) There is an accumulation of evidence to show that the
earliest historical races excelled in many processes in the arts
and in many kinds of culture. He instances the wonderful
mechanical and engineering skill evidenced in the pyramids of
Egypt in proof of this. His conclusion is either that the origin
of man by development from apes must be pushed much farther back
than any geologists at present hold, and I may add far beyond any
probable date, or that he must have originated by some "distinct
and higher agency"&mdash;which last is no doubt the true conclusion.</p>

<p>Haeckel, in his recent work, the "History of Creation," sketches
the development of man from a monad, in twenty-two stages; but he
has to admit that stage twenty-first, or that of the "Ape-like
man," nowhere exists, either recent or fossil. He has to assume
that this missing link has perished in the submergence of an
imaginary continent of Lemuria, in the Indian Ocean; and it is
instructive to observe that, after deducting this, his
affiliation of the races of men, as indicated in a map of the
distribution of the species, is in the main very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
similar to that with which we are familiar in ordinary collections of maps
illustrative of the Bible.</p>

<p>The Post-glacial, Pal&aelig;ocosmic, or Pal&aelig;olithic men of Europe are
not improbably antediluvian; and as to their precise date we know
little. As to postdiluvian man, Canon Rawlinson has recently
pointed out
<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
the remarkable convergence of all historic dates
toward a time between 2000 to 3000 years B.C., or about the date
of the Biblical deluge, which may reasonably be inferred to have
occurred about 3200 B.C. He gives the following summary of
historical origins as ascertained from the best data, and which
accord with the representation of the Bible that in the time of
Abraham the great monarchies of Egypt and the East were scarcely
more powerful than the nomad tribe led by that patriarch:</p>

<table summary="historical origins">
<tr><td>Oldest date of </td><td>Babylon</td><td>2300 B.C.</td></tr>
<tr><td>" "</td><td>Assyria</td><td>1500</td></tr>
<tr><td>" "</td><td>Iran</td><td>1500</td></tr>
<tr><td>" "</td><td>India</td><td>1200</td></tr>
<tr><td>" "</td><td>China</td><td>1154</td></tr>
<tr><td>" "</td><td>Phoenicia</td><td>1700</td></tr>
<tr><td>" "</td><td>Troad</td><td>2000</td></tr>
<tr><td>" "</td><td>Egypt</td><td>2760</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sept. date of </td><td>Deluge</td><td>3200</td></tr>
</table>

<p>He rejects, of course, the fabulous chronologies of Egypt, China,
and India as mythical, or referring to prehuman and antediluvian
periods. It is to be observed that while these dates place the
origins of the oldest civilized nations at periods considerably
subsequent to the deluge, they do not prevent us from supposing
that these nations commenced their existence wills an advanced
civilization borrowed from antediluvian times, which is indeed a
fair conclusion from the Biblical history, independently of the
monumental evidence referred to by Wallace in a previous
paragraph.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
The Duke of Argyll, in his excellent little work "Primeval Man,"
in which he discusses the arguments in favor of primitive
savagery advanced by Sir J. Lubbock in opposition to the views of
Archbishop Whately in his lecture on the "Origin of
Civilization," shows that there is no necessity to suppose a slow
progress of mankind in the arts extending over indefinite ages;
and his argument in this respect connects itself with the facts
as to the high cerebral organization of Pal&aelig;ocosmic men referred
to above by Wallace. In summing up one division of his argument,
he truly remarks: "If we assume with the supporters of the
savage-theory that man has himself invented all that he now
knows, then the very earliest inventions of our race must have
been the most wonderful of all, and the richest in the fruits
they bore. The man who first discovered the use of fire, and the
use of those grasses which we now know under the name of corn,
were discoverers compared with whom, as regards the value of
their ideas to the world, Faraday and Wheatstone are but the
inventors of ingenious toys. It may possibly be true, as Whately
argues, that man never could have discovered these things without
divine instruction. If so, it is fatal to the savage theory. But
it is equally fatal to that theory if we assume the opposite
position, and suppose that the noblest discoveries ever made by
man were made by him in primeval times."</p>

<p>I may add that this is true, however far into antiquity we may
stretch back these primeval times.</p>

<p>Professor E. S. Morse, in his address to the American
Association, in 1876, as vice-president, takes as a theme the
contributions of American zoologists to theories of evolution,
and closes with those which refer to what he modestly terms
"man's lowly origin." These contributions he sums up under three
heads, as bearing on the following points: "1. That in his
earlier stages he reveals certain persistent characters of the
ape; 2. That the more ancient men reveal more ape-like features
than the present existing men; and, 3. That certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
characteristics pertaining to early men still persist in the
inferior races of men." Under the first head he gives
contributions to the well-known fact that embryonic stages of the
human being, like those of other high types, approximate to forms
permanent in lower types. This is a fact inseparable from the law
of reproduction; and as has been already shown in the text,
absolutely without logical significance as even an analogical
argument in favor of evolution. Under the second and third heads,
he refers to cases of exceptional skulls and bones belonging to
idiots and degraded races of men, as showing tendencies to lower
forms, which as a matter of course they do, though with essential
differences still marking them as human; and he assumes without
any proof that these were relatively more common in primitive
times, and that they are cases of reversion to a previous simian
stage, instead of being results of abnormal conditions in the
individual or variety. He sums up these arguments in the
following paragraph:</p>

<p>"If we take into account the rapidly accumulating data of
European naturalists concerning primitive man, with the mass of
evidence presented in these notes, we find an array of facts
which irresistibly point to a common origin with animals directly
below us, and these evidences are found in the massive skulls
with coarse ridges for muscular attachments, the rounding of the
base of the nostrils, the early ossification of the nasal bones,
the small cranial capacity in certain forms, the prominence of
the frontal crest, the posterior position of the <i>foramen
magnum</i>, the approximation of the temporal ridges, the lateral
flattening of the tibia, the perforation of the humerus, the
tendency of the pelvis to depart from its usual proportions; and,
associated with all these, a rudeness of culture and the evidence
of the manifestation of the coarsest instincts. He must be blind,
indeed, who can not recognize the bearing of such grave and
suggestive modifications."</p>

<p>Yet Professor Morse knows that there is no true specific or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
even generic kinship between man and any species of ape; that the
phenomena of idiocy and degeneracy have no real resemblance to
those of distinct specific types; that the resemblances of man to
apes, such as they are, point not in a direct manner to any stock
of apes, but in a desultory way to several; and consequently
that, if derived from any such animals, it must be from some
stock altogether unknown to us as yet, either among recent or
fossil animals. Farther, as Cope, himself an evolutionist,
admits, while we can trace the skeletons of Eocene mammals
through several directions of specialization in succeeding
Tertiary times, man presents the phenomenon of an unspecialized
skeleton which can not fairly be connected with any of these
lines. Lastly, his quotation from Fiske, with reference to the
supposed effect of a protracted infancy to develop the moral
characteristics of man, though accompanied with the usual unfair
and unreasonable sneer (which a naturalist like Morse should have
been ashamed to quote) against men "still capable of believing
that the human race was created by miracle in a single day," is
the feeblest possible attempt to bridge over the gap between the
spiritual nature of man and the merely psychical nature of
brutes.</p>

<p>It is plain that if American naturalists have done nothing more
in favor of the lowly origin of man than that which Professor
Morse has been able, evidently with much industry and pains, to
gather, we need not for the present abandon our claims to a
higher origin. It is farther significant in connection with this
that Professor Huxley, in his lectures in New York, while resting
his case as to the lower animals mainly on the supposed genealogy
of the horse, which has often been shown to amount to no certain
evidence,
<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
avoided altogether the discussion of the origin of
man from apes, now obviously complicated with so many
difficulties that both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
Wallace and Mivart are staggered by them.
Professor Thomas, in his recent lectures,
<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
admits that there is no lower man known than the Australian, and that there is no
known link of connection with the monkeys; and Haeckel
<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
has to admit that the penultimate link in his phylogeny, the ape-like
man, is absolutely unknown.</p>

<p>In Chapter XIII. I have not touched on the question of the
absolute origin of language&mdash;this not being necessary to my
argument. On this interesting subject, however, we have, in the
naming of the animals by the first man, recorded in the second
chapter of Genesis, not only the primary truth of his superiority
to them, but a farther indication that the roots of human speech,
other than interjectional, lie in onomatopoeia, and especially
in the voices of animals, and that the gift of speech was not the
slow growth of ages, but an endowment of man from the first, just
as much as any of his other powers or properties. An interesting
discussion of this subject will be found in the concluding
chapters of Wilson's "Prehistoric Man," second edition. Farther,
the so-called "tallies" found with the bones of Pal&aelig;ocosmic men
in European caves, and illustrated in the admirable work of
Christy and Lartet, show that the rudiments even of writing were
already in possession of the oldest race of men known to
arch&aelig;ology or geology. (See Wilson, <i>op. cit.</i>, vol. ii., p. 54.)</p>

<p>I have not noticed, except incidentally, the alleged discoveries
of very ancient human remains in America, as they all appear very
problematical. There is, however, some evidence of the
coexistence of man with the mastodon and other postglacial
animals in Illinois and elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">F.&mdash;BEARING OF GLACIAL PERIODS UPON THE INTERPRETATION OF GENESIS.</span></h2>

<p>Whatever views may be taken as to that period of cold which
occurs at the close of the Tertiary and beginning of the Modern
period, it can not be held to have constituted any such break as
to be considered, as it was at one time, an equivalent for the
Biblical chaos. This is proved by the survival through this
period of a very large proportion of the animals and plants still
existing in the northern hemisphere. The chronological system of
animals and plants has been continuous, as the Bible represents
it, since their first appearance on earth.</p>

<p>It is further remarkable that while there is geological evidence
of climates colder than the present in the temperate regions,
there is equally good proof of warmer climates even within the
arctic circle than those of the cold temperate regions at
present. It is difficult to account for these vicissitudes of
climate, and much controversy exists on the subject; but it seems
certain that in the earlier Tertiary and Cretaceous periods, for
example, the supplies of heat and light were so diffused over the
earth as to permit the growth of a temperate vegetation in
Greenland, and even in Spitzbergen. Geologists, however
unwillingly, have been obliged to admit this as one of those
great possibilities, altogether unexpected beforehand, which have
been developed in the history of our planet. Various modes of
explaining this succession of cold and warm periods have been
adopted, all more or less hypothetical. Lyell has argued that it
may be explained by a different distribution of land and water
and of the ocean currents.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
Croll accounts for it by the varying
eccentricity of the earth's orbit, in connection with the
precession of the equinoxes. Evans by a shifting of the axis of
rotation of the earth. Drayson, Bell, Warring, and others, by a
change in the inclination of the earth's axis. Others by the
secular diminution of the internal heat of the earth, and of that
of the sun. Others by the supposed recurrence of periods in which
the sun gives more or less heat, or in which the earth is passing
through colder or warmer regions of space. As the subject is of
interest with reference to possible correspondences of these
great summers and winters of the earth with the stages of the
creative work, it may be well to notice shortly the relative
merits of these theories.</p>

<p>(1.) The hypothesis of Croll is one of the most ingenious and
elaborate of the whole; but it has two great defects. One is that
the causes alleged are so uncertain and so complicated that it is
difficult to estimate their real value. Another is that it proves
too much, namely, a regular succession of cold and warm periods
throughout geological time, of which we have no good evidence,
and which is on many grounds improbable.</p>

<p>(2.) That the earth's axis of rotation has continued unchanged
throughout the whole of the geological ages seems proved by the
fact that the principal lines of crumpling and upheaval from the
Laurentian period downward are arranged in great circles of the
earth tangent to the polar circle; and that the lines of deposit
of sediment in the Pal&aelig;ozoic age are coincident with the present
direction of the arctic currents.</p>

<p>(3.) Astronomers consider it improbable that the obliquity of the
ecliptic has materially changed, and serious differences of
opinion exist as to the effects which a greater or less obliquity
would produce on climate. It seems certain, however, that a less
obliquity would occasion a more uniform distribution of heat and
light throughout the year; and this, co-operating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
with other causes leading to a warm climate, might enable a temperate
vegetation to approach the pole more closely than at present.</p>

<p>(4.) That the energy of the sun's radiation and the internal heat
of the earth have been slowly decreasing seems certain; but it is
now generally admitted that these changes are so gradual that
little effect can have been produced by them, except in the older
geological periods, and that they can have no connection with the
great glacial period of the Post-pliocene.</p>

<p>(5.) It is otherwise with the hypothesis that the sun's heat may,
like that of some variable stars, have increased and diminished.
There is, of course, no direct evidence of this, except the small
differences observed in cycles of eleven and fifty-five years
from the greater or less development of sunspots, and the analogy
of observed variable stars. Still it is a possible cause of
variations of climate. It might also aid in accounting for the
extraordinary evidences of desert conditions and desiccation
presented by the salt deposits of different geological periods in
temperate latitudes.</p>

<p>(6.) The theory of the passage of the earth through zones of
space of variable temperature is now generally abandoned, as
there seems no reason to believe that such differences exist.</p>

<p>(7.) The theory of Lyell that changes in the distribution of land
and water may, with the possible co-operation of other causes,
have produced the observed diversities of climate, is that which
seems best to meet the conditions presented. It is based on the
known properties of land and water as to the absorption,
radiation, and convection of heat, and on the remarkable
diversities of climate in similar latitudes arising from this
cause at present. Farther, it accords with the known fact that
very great changes of level have occurred in connection with the
glacial period. This theory undoubtedly embraces a true cause,
admitted by all geologists, and it dispenses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
with the necessity of believing in the recurrence of glacial periods at regular
intervals. It farther accords best with the evidence afforded by
fossils, and especially by fossil plants. It has also the merit
of directing due attention to the diversities of geographical
conditions at different periods, and of dealing with causes of
change operating within the earth itself. The only doubt with
respect to it is its sufficiency to explain the changes which
have occurred, and the view entertained of this will depend very
much on the interpretation of the facts as to the intensity of
the last glacial period. If moderate views can be taken of this,
and if means can be found, by a less obliquity of the ecliptic or
otherwise, to furnish a continuous supply of light in the arctic
regions, the difficulties which have been alleged against it
would disappear.</p>

<p>(8.) In connection with former periods of cold and warmth, and
with the existence of temperate and tropical vegetation in polar
latitudes, we should not forget that view which takes into
account the probable effects of different conditions of the
atmosphere, and the greater quantity of carbonic acid present in
it, in early geological periods. This would, of course, best
apply to the pal&aelig;ozoic floras, in so far as our present knowledge
extends; but there may have been similar conditions in later
periods. Dr. Sterry Hunt thus states this hypothesis:</p>

<p>"The agency of plants in purifying the primitive atmosphere was
long since pointed out by Brongniart, and our great stores of
fossil fuel have been derived from the decomposition, by the
ancient vegetation, of the excess of carbonic acid of the early
atmosphere, which through this agency was exchanged for oxygen
gas. In this connection the vegetation of former periods presents
the curious phenomenon of plants allied to those now growing
beneath the tropics flourishing within the polar circles. Many
ingenious hypotheses have been proposed to account for the warmer
climate of earlier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
times, but are at best unsatisfactory, and it
appears to me that the true solution of the problem may be found
in the constitution of the early atmosphere, when considered in
the light of Dr. Tyndall's beautiful researches on radiant heat.
He has found that the presence of a few hundredths of
carbonic-acid gas in the atmosphere, while offering almost no
obstacle to the passage of the solar rays, would suffice to
prevent almost entirely the loss by radiation of obscure heat, so
that the surface of the land beneath such an atmosphere would
become like a vast orchard-house, in which the conditions of
climate necessary to a luxuriant vegetation would be extended
even to the polar regions."</p>

<p>It is obvious that, in the production of complex effects of this
kind, various causes, whether astronomical or connected with the
mutations of the earth's crust, may have co-operated, and
probably in all extreme cases did co-operate.</p>

<p>In any case it is evident that the vicissitudes of climate and
the great pulsations of the crust, which have raised and
depressed portions of the surface and changed the position of its
covering of waters, have been potent agents in the hands of the
Creator in effecting the changes and succession of living beings,
which are thus, as Genesis intimates, children of the waters and
of the land, and of the influences of the heavens. It is also
interesting in this connection to observe that the occurrence of
such periods of general warm climate as that in the Miocene shows
that it would have been possible for man, under certain
conditions, to have extended himself far more widely in his
Edenic state than we can conceive of in the present condition of
the earth. The modern world is perhaps even in this way "cursed"
for man's sake</p>

<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">G.&mdash;DR. STERRY HUNT ON THE CHEMISTRY OF THE PRIMEVAL EARTH.</span></h2>

<p>On looking back to the reference to this subject in Chapter V., I
think it may be desirable to present to the reader in some more
definite manner the conditions of a forming world; and I can not
do this in any other way so well as by quoting the words of Dr.
Sterry Hunt, as given in the abstract of his lecture on this
subject delivered before the Royal Institution of London in 1867:</p>

<p>"This hypothesis of the nature of the sun and of the luminous
process going on at its surface is the one lately put forward by
Faye, and, although it has met with opposition, appears to be
that which accords best with our present knowledge of the
chemical and physical conditions of matter, such as we must
suppose it to exist in the condensing gaseous mass which,
according to the nebular hypothesis, should form the centre of
our solar system. Taking this, as we have already done, for
granted, it matters little whether we imagine the different
planets to have been successively detached as rings during the
rotation of the primal mass, as is generally conceived, or
whether we admit with Chacornac a process of aggregation or
concretion, operating within the primal nebular mass, resulting
in the production of sun and planets. In either case we come to
the conclusion that our earth must at one time have been in an
intensely heated gaseous condition, such as the sun now presents,
self-luminous, and with a process of condensation going on at
first at the surface only, until by cooling it must have reached
the point where the gaseous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
centre was exchanged for one of combined and liquefied matter.</p>

<p>"Here commences the chemistry of the earth, to the discussion of
which the foregoing considerations have been only preliminary. So
long as the gaseous condition of the earth lasted, we may suppose
the whole mass to have been homogeneous; but when the temperature
became so reduced that the existence of chemical compounds at the
centre became possible, those which were most stable at the
elevated temperature then prevailing would be first formed. Thus,
for example, while compounds of oxygen with mercury or even with
hydrogen could not exist, oxides of silicon, aluminium, calcium,
magnesium, and iron might be formed and condense in a liquid form
at the centre of the globe. By progressive cooling, still other
elements would be removed from the gaseous mass, which would form
the atmosphere of the non-gaseous nucleus. We may suppose an
arrangement of the condensed matters at the centre according to
their respective specific gravities, and thus the fact that the
density of the earth as a whole is about twice the mean density
of the matters which form its solid surface may be explained.
Metallic or metalloidal compounds of elements, grouped
differently from any compounds known to us, and far more dense,
may exist in the centre of the earth.</p>

<p>"The process of combination and cooling having gone on until
those elements which are not volatile in the heat of our ordinary
furnaces were condensed into a liquid form, we may here inquire
what would be the result, upon the mass, of a further reduction
of temperature. It is generally assumed that in the cooling of a
liquid globe of mineral matter, congelation would commence at the
surface, as in the case of water; but water offers an exception
to most other liquids, inasmuch as it is denser in the liquid
than in the solid form. Hence ice floats on water, and freezing
water becomes covered with a layer of ice, which protects the
liquid below.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
With most other matters, however, and notably with
the various mineral and earthy compounds analogous to those which
may be supposed to have formed the fiery-fluid earth, numerous
and careful experiments show that the products of solidification
are much denser than the liquid mass; so that solidification
would have commenced at the centre, whose temperature would thus
be the congealing point of these liquid compounds. The important
researches of Hopkins and Fairbairn on the influence of pressure
in augmenting the melting-point of such compounds as contract in
solidifying are to be considered in this connection.</p>

<p>"It is with the superficial portions of the fused mineral mass of
the globe that we have now to do; since there is no good reason
for supposing that the deeply seated portions have intervened in
any direct manner in the production of the rocks which form the
superficial crust. This, at the time of its first solidification,
presented probably an irregular, diversified surface from the
result of contraction of the congealing mass, which at last
formed a liquid bath of no great depth surrounding the solid
nucleus. It is to the composition of this crust that we must
direct our attention, since therein would be found all the
elements (with the exception of such as were still in the gaseous
form) now met with in the known rocks of the earth. This crust is
now everywhere buried beneath its own ruins, and we can only from
chemical considerations attempt to reconstruct it. If we consider
the conditions through which it has passed, and the chemical
affinities which must have come into play, we shall see that
these are just what would now result if the solid land, sea, and
air were made to react upon each other under the influence of
intense heat. To the chemist it is at once evident that from this
would result the conversion of all carbonates, chlorides, and
sulphates into silicates, and the separation of the carbon,
chlorine, and sulphur in the form of acid gases, which, with
nitrogen, watery vapor, and a probable excess of oxygen, would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
form the dense primeval atmosphere. The resulting fused mass
would contain all the bases as silicates, and must have much
resembled in composition certain furnace-slags or volcanic
glasses. The atmosphere, charged with acid gases, which
surrounded this primitive rock must have been of immense density.
Under the pressure of such a high barometric column, condensation
would take place at a temperature much above the present
boiling-point of water, and the depressed portions of the
half-cooled crust would be flooded with a highly heated solution
of hydrochloric acid, whose action in decomposing the silicates
is easily intelligible to the chemist. The formation of chlorides
of the various bases, and the separation of silica, would go on
until the affinities of the acid were satisfied, and there would
be a separation of silica, taking the form of quartz, and the
production of a sea-water holding in solution, besides the
chlorides of sodium, calcium, and magnesium, salts of aluminium
and other metallic bases. The atmosphere, being thus deprived of
its volatile chlorine and sulphur compounds, would approximate to
that of our own time, but differ in its greater amount of
carbonic acid.</p>

<p>"We next enter into the second phase in the action of the
atmosphere upon the earth's crust. This, unlike the first, which
was subaqueous, or operative only on the portion covered with the
precipitated water, is sub-aerial, and consists in the
decomposition of the exposed parts of the primitive crust under
the influence of the carbonic acid and moisture of the air, which
convert the complex silicates of the crust into a silicate of
alumina, or clay, while the separated lime, magnesia, and
alkalies, being converted into carbonates, are carried down into
the sea in a state of solution.</p>

<p>"The first effect of these dissolved carbonates would be to
precipitate the dissolved alumina and the heavy metals, after
which would result a decomposition of the chloride of calcium of
the sea-water, resulting in the production of carbonate of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
lime or limestone, and chloride of sodium or common salt. This process
is one still going on at the earth's surface, slowly breaking
down and destroying the hardest rocks, and, aided by mechanical
processes, transforming them into clays; although the action,
from the comparative rarity of carbonic acid in the atmosphere,
is less energetic than in earlier times, when the abundance of
this gas, and a higher temperature, favored the chemical
decomposition of the rocks. But now, as then, every clod of clay
formed from the decay of a crystalline rock corresponded to an
equivalent of carbonic acid abstracted from the atmosphere, and
equivalents of carbonate of lime and common salt formed from the
chloride of calcium of the sea-water."

<p>We learn from the above comparative view that the <i>tannin</i> is an
aquatic animal of large size, and predaceous, clothed with
scales, and a fit emblem of the monarchies of Egypt and Assyria.
In two places it is possible that some species of serpent is
denoted by it. We must suppose, therefore, that in Genesis i. it
denotes large crocodilian and perhaps serpentiform reptiles. The
<i>tan</i> is evidently a small mammal of the desert.</p>

<p>I omitted to notice in the text a criticism of my explanation of
the word <i>bhemah</i> in "Archaia," made in Archdeacon Pratt's
"Scripture and Science not at Variance" (edition of 1872). He
opposes to the meaning of "herbivorous animals" which I have
sought to establish, two exceptional passages. In one of these,
Deut. xxviii., 26, the word is used in its most general sense for
all beasts, which the context shows can not be its meaning in
Gen. i. In the other, Prov. xxx., 30, he says it is applied to
the lion. The actual expression used, however, merely implies
that the lion is "mighty among <i>bhemah</i>," the comparison being
probably between the strength of the lion and that of oxen,
antelopes, and other strong and active creatures. It does not
affirm that the lion is one of the <i>bhemah</i>. While I have every
respect for the erudition of Archdeacon Pratt, and highly value
his book, I must regard this objection as an example of a style
of biblical exposition much to be deprecated, though too often
employed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">I.&mdash;ANCIENT MYTHOLOGIES.</span></h2>

<p>The current views respecting the relations of ancient mythologies
with each other and with the Bible have been continually shifting
and oscillating between extremes. The latest and at present most
popular of these extreme views is that so well expounded by Dr.
Max M&uuml;ller in his various essays on these subjects, and which
traces at least the Indo-European theogony to a mere
personification of natural objects. The views given in the text
are those which to the author appear alone compatible with the
Bible, and with the relations of Semitic and Aryan theology; but,
as the subject is generally regarded from a quite different point
of view, a little further explanation may be necessary.</p>

<p>1. According to the Bible, spiritual monotheism is the primitive
faith of man, and with this it ranks the doctrine of a malignant
spirit or being opposed to God, and of a primitive state of
perfection and happiness. It is scarcely necessary to say that
these doctrines may be found as sub-strata in all the ancient
theologies.</p>

<p>2. In the Hebrew theology the fall introduces the new doctrine of
a mediator or deliverer, human and divine, and an external
symbolism, that of the cherubic forms, composite figures made up
of parts of the man, the lion, the ox, and the eagle. These forms
are referred back to Eden, where they are manifestly the emblems
of the perfections of the Deity, lost to man by the fall, and now
opposed to his entrance into Eden and access to the tree of life,
the symbol of his immortal happiness. Subsequently the cherubim
are the visible indications of the presence of God in the
tabernacle and temple; and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
the Apocalypse they reappear as
emblems of the Divine perfections, as reflected in the character
of man redeemed. The cherubim, as guardians of the sacred tree,
and of sacred places in general, appear in the worship of the
Assyrians and Egyptians, as the winged lions and bulls of the
former, and the sphinx of the latter. They can also be recognized
in the sepulchral monuments of Greek Asia and of Etruria.
Farther, it was evidently an easy step to proceed from these
cherubic figures to the adoration of sacred animals. But the
cherubic emblems were connected with the idea of a coming
Redeemer, and this was with equal ease perverted into
hero-worship. Every great conqueror, inventor, or reformer was
thus recognized as in some sense the "coming man," just as Eve
supposed she saw him in her first-born. In addition to this, the
sacredness of the first mother as the mother of the promised seed
of the woman, led to the introduction of female deities.</p>

<p>3. The earliest ecclesiastical system was the patriarchal, and
this also admitted of corruption into idolatry. The great
patriarch, venerable by age and wisdom, when he left this earth
for the spirit world, was supposed there, in the presence of God,
to be the special guardian of his children on earth. Some of the
gods of Egypt and of Greece were obviously of this character, and
in China and Polynesia we see at this day this kind of idolatry
in a condition of active vitality.</p>

<p>4. As stated in the text, the mythology of Egypt and Greece bears
evident marks of having personified certain cosmological facts
akin to those of the Hebrew narrative of creation. In this way
ancient idolators disposed of the prehistoric and pre-Adamite
world, changing it into a period of gods and demigods. This is
very apparent in the remarkable Assyrian Genesis recovered by the
late George Smith from the clay tablets found in the ruined
palace of Assurbanipal.</p>

<p>5. In all rude and imaginative nations, which have lost the
distinct idea of the one God, the Creator, nature becomes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
more or less a source of superstitions. Its grand and more rare
phenomena of volcanoes, earthquakes, thunder-storms, eclipses,
become supernatural portents; and as the idea of power associates
itself with them, they are personified as actual agents and
become gods. In like manner, the more constant and useful objects
and processes of nature become personified as beneficent deities.
This may be, to a great extent, the character of the Aryan
theology; but, except where all ideas of primitive religion and
traditions of early history have been lost, it can not be the
whole of the religion of any people. The Bible negatively
recognizes this source of idolatry, in so constantly referring
all natural phenomena to the divine decree. In connection with
this, it is worthy of remark that rude man tends to venerate the
new animal forms of strange lands. Something of this kind has
probably led some of the American Indians to give a sort of
divine honor to the bear. It was in Egypt that man first became
familiar with the strange and gigantic fauna of Africa, whose
effect on his mind in primitive times we may gather from the book
of Job. In Egypt, consequently, there must have been a strong
natural tendency to the adoration of animals.</p>

<p>The above origins of idolatry and mythology, as stated or implied
in the Bible, of course assume that the Semitic monotheistic
religion is the primitive one. The first deviations from it
probably originated in the family of Ham. A city of the Rephaim
of Bashan was in the days of Abraham named after Ashtoreth
Karnaim&mdash;the two-horned Astarte, a female divinity and prototype
of Diana, and perhaps an historic personage, in whom both the
moon and the domestic ox were rendered objects of worship. This
is the earliest Bible notice of idolatry.
<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
In Egypt a mythology of complex diversity existed at least as far back. We
must remember, however, that Egypt is Cush as well as Mizraim,
and its idolatry is probably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
to be traced, in the first instance, to the Nimrodic empire, from which, as from a common
centre, certain new and irreligious ideas seem to have been
propagated among all the branches of the human family. It is
quite probable that the correspondences between Egyptian, Greek,
and Hindoo myths go back as far as to the time when the first
despotism was erected on the plain of Shinar, and when able but
ungodly men set themselves to erect new political and social
institutions on the ruins of all that their fathers had held
sacred. In addition to this, the mythology and language of the
Aryans alike bear the impress of the innovating and restless
spirit of the sons of Japhet.</p>

<p>I have stated the above propositions to show that the Bible
affords a rational and connected theory of the origin of the
false religions of antiquity; and to suggest as inquiries in
relation to every form of mythology&mdash;how much of it is primitive
monotheism, how much cherub-worship, how much hero-worship, how
much ancestor-worship, how much distorted cosmogony, how much
pure idealism and superstition, since all these are usually
present. I may be allowed further to remind the reader how much
evidence we have, even in modern times, of the strong tendency of
the human mind to fall into one or another of these forms of
idolatry; and to ask him to reflect that really the only
effectual conservative element is that of revelation. How strong
an argument is this for the necessity to man of an inspired rule
of religious faith.</p>

<p>[The above note was in substance contained in the Appendix to
"Archaia" in 1860, and its correctness has, I think, been
confirmed by subsequent discoveries.</p>

<p>]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">K.&mdash;ASSYRIAN AND EGYPTIAN TEXTS.</span></h2>

<p>Progress is continually being made in the decipherment and
publication of these, and new facts are coming to light in
consequence as to the religions of the early postdiluvian period.</p>

<p>According to the late George Smith and to Mr. Sayce, in their
contributions to Bagster's "Records of the Past," the earliest
monumental history of Babylonia reveals two races, the Akkadian
or Urdu, a Turanian race, with an agglutinate language of the
Finnish or Tartar type, and the Sumir or Keen-gi, believed to be
Shemitic. The race of Akkad seems to have invented the cuneiform
writing at a very early period, and it no doubt represents the
primitive Cushites of the Bible, to whom is attributed the empire
of Nimrod, whose first cities were Babel and Erech and Akkad and
Calneh. Very ancient inscriptions of this early Chaldean or
Cushite race exist, probably earlier than the time of Abraham.
That of king Urukh, who is called "a very ancient king," on an
inscription of Nabonadius, 555 B.C., represents himself as
building temples to several gods and goddesses, so that in his
time there was already a developed polytheism, unless, indeed, he
was himself the inventor or introducer of much of it. Yet one can
gather from the probably contemporary Creation and Deluge tablets
translated by Mr. Smith, that a Supreme God was still recognized,
and that the subordinate deities, though their worship was
probably gaining in importance, were still only local and created
beings. Yet it was undoubtedly from this embryo idolatry that
Abraham dissented, and was thus led to leave his native land.</p>

<p>

In like manner, in the early Egyptian Hymn to Amen Ra, translated
by Mr. Goodwin, though we have the gods mentioned, they are
inferior beings, and not higher in position than the angels of
the Old Testament, while Ra himself is "Lord of Eternity, Maker
Everlasting," and is praised as</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;margin-left:30%;">"Chief creator of the whole earth,<br />
Supporter of affairs above every god,<br />
In whose goodness the gods rejoice."</p>

<p>Thus, although there can be little doubt that Ra was a sun-god,
there can be as little that he is the Il or El of the Shemitic
peoples, and that his worship represents that of the one God, the
Creator. It seems probable also that there was an esoteric
doctrine of this kind among the priests and the educated, however
gross the polytheism of the vulgar. In short, the state of things
in Assyria and Egypt was not dissimilar from that prevailing at
this day in India, where learned men may fall back upon the
ancient Vedas, and maintain that their religion is monotheistic,
while the common people worship innumerable gods. All this points
to a primitive monotheism, just as the peculiar forms of
adoration given to saints and the Virgin Mary in the Greek and
Roman churches historically imply a primitive Christianity on
which these newer beliefs and rites have been engrafted.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size:70%;">L.&mdash;SPECIES AND VARIETAL FORMS WITH REFERENCE TO THE UNITY OF
MAN.</span></h2>

<p>In the concluding chapters of "Archaia" the nature of species, as
distinguished from varieties, was discussed, and specially
applied to the varieties and races of man. This discussion has
been omitted from the text of the present work; but, in an
abridged form, is introduced here, with especial reference to
those more recent views of this subject now prevalent in
consequence of the growth of the philosophy of evolution; but
which I feel convinced must, with the progress of science, return
nearer to the opinions held by me in 1860, and summarized below.</p>

<p>We can determine species only by the comparison of individuals.
If all these agree in all their characters except those
appertaining to sex, age, and other conditions of the individual
merely, we say that they belong to the same species. If all
species were invariable to this extent, there could be no
practical difficulty, except that of obtaining specimens for
comparison. But in the case of very many species there are minor
differences, not sufficient to establish specific diversity, but
to suggest its possibility; and in such cases there is often
great liability to error. In cases of this kind we have
principally two criteria: first, the nature and amount of the
differences; secondly, their shading gradually into each other,
or the contrary. Under the first of these we inquire&mdash;Are they no
greater in amount than those which may be observed in individuals
of the same parentage? Are they no greater than those which occur
in other species of similar structure or habits?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
Do they occur in points known in other species to be readily variable, or in
points that usually remain unchanged? Are none of them constant
in the one supposed species, and constantly absent in the other?
Under the second we ask&mdash;Are the individuals presenting these
differences connected together by others showing a series of
gradations uniting the extremes by minute degrees of difference?
If we can answer these questions&mdash;or such of them as we have the
means of answering&mdash;in the affirmative, we have no hesitation in
referring all to the same species. If obliged to answer all or
many in the negative, we must at least hesitate in the
identification; and if the material is abundant, and the
distinguishing characters clear and well defined, we conclude
that there is a specific difference.</p>

<p>Species determined in this way must possess certain general
properties in common:</p>

<p>1. Their individuals must fall within a certain range of uniform
characters, wider or narrower in the case of different species.</p>

<p>2. The intervals between species must be distinctly marked, and
not slurred over by intermediate gradations.</p>

<p>3. The specific characters must be invariably transmitted from
generation to generation, so that they remain equally distinct in
their limits if traced backward or forward in time, in so far as
our observation may extend.</p>

<p>4. Within the limits of the species there is more or less
liability to variation; and this, though perhaps developed by
external circumstances, is really inherent in the species, and
must necessarily form a part of its proper description.</p>

<p>5. There is also a physiological distinction between species,
namely, that the individuals are sterile with one another,
whereas this does not apply to varieties; and though Darwin has
labored to break down this distinction by insisting on rare
exceptional cases, and suggesting many supposed ways by which
varieties of the same species might possibly attain to this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
kind of distinctness, the difference still remains as a fact in
nature; though one not readily available in practically
distinguishing species.</p>

<p>These general properties of species will, I think, be admitted by
all naturalists as based on nature, and absolutely necessary to
the existence of natural history as a science, independently of
any hypotheses as to the possible changes of specific forms in
the lapse of time. I now proceed to give a similar summary of the
laws of the varieties which may exist&mdash;always be it observed,
within the limits of the species.</p>

<p>1. The limits of variation are very different in different
species. There are many in which no well-marked variations have
been observed. There are others in which the variations are so
marked that they have been divided, even by skilful naturalists,
into distinct species or even genera. I do not here refer to
differences of age and sex. These in many animals are so great
that nothing but actual knowledge of the relation that subsists
would prevent the individuals from being entirely separated from
one another. I refer merely to the varieties that exist in adults
of the same sex, including, however, those that depend on arrest
of development, and thus make the adult of one variety resemble
in some respects the young of another; as, for instance, in the
hornless oxen, and beardless individuals among men. If we inquire
as to the causes on which the greater or less disposition to vary
depends, we must, in the first place, confess our ignorance, by
saying that it appears to be in a great measure constitutional,
or dependent on minute and as yet not distinctly appreciable
structural, physiological, and psychical characters. Darwin
states that Pallas long ago suggested, from the known facts that
the seeds of hybrid plants and grafted trees are very variable,
the theory that mixture of breeds tends to produce variability;
but Darwin does not seem to attach much importance to this, and
admits our inability to explain the origin of these
differences.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
We know, however, certain properties of
species that are always or usually connected with great liability
to variation. The principal of these are the following: 1. The
liability to vary is, in many cases, not merely a specific
peculiarity; it is often general in the members of a genus or
family. Thus the cats, as a family, are little prone to vary; the
wolves and foxes very much so. 2. Species that are very widely
distributed over the earth's surface are usually very variable.
In this case the capacity to vary probably adapts the creature to
a great variety of circumstances, and so enables it to be widely
distributed. It must be observed here that hardiness and
variability of constitution are more important to extensive
distribution than mere locomotive powers, for matters have
evidently been so arranged in nature that, where the habitat is
suitable, colonists will find their way to it, even in the face
of difficulties almost insurmountable. 3. Constitutional
liability to vary is sometimes connected with or dependent on
extreme simplicity of structure, in other cases on a high degree
of intelligence and consequent adaptation to various modes of
subsistence. Those minute, simply organized, and very variable
creatures, the Foraminifera, exemplify the first of these
apparent causes; the crafty wolves furnish examples of the
second. 4. Susceptibility to variation is farther modified by the
greater or less adaptability of the digestive and locomotive
organs to varied kinds of food and habitat. The monkeys,
intelligent, imitative, and active, are nevertheless very limited
in range and variability, because they can comfortably subsist
only in forests, and in the warmer regions of the earth. The hog,
more sluggish and less intelligent, has an omnivorous appetite,
and no very special requirements of habitat, and so can vary
greatly and extend over a large portion of the earth. Farther, in
connection with this subject it may be observed that the
conditions favorable to variation are also in the case
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
of the higher animals favorable to domestication, while it may also be
affirmed that, other things being equal, animals in a
domesticated state are much more liable to vary than those in a
wild state, and this independent of intentional selection. Darwin
admits this, and gives many examples of it.</p>

<p>2. Varieties may originate in two different ways. In the case of
wild animals it is generally supposed that they are gradually
induced by the slow operation of external influences; but it is
certain that in domesticated animals they often appear suddenly
and unexpectedly, and are not on that account at all less
permanent. A large proportion of our breeds of domestic animals
appear to originate in this way. A very remarkable instance is
that of the "Niata" cattle of the Banda Orientale, described by
Darwin in his "Voyage of a Naturalist." These cattle are believed
to have originated about a century ago among the Indians to the
south of the La Plata, and the breed propagates itself with great
constancy. "They appear," says Darwin, "externally to hold nearly
the same relation to other cattle which bull-dogs hold to other
dogs. Their forehead is very short and broad, with the nasal end
turned up, and the upper lip much drawn back; their lower jaws
project outward; when walking they carry their heads low on a
short neck, and their hinder legs are rather longer compared with
the front legs than is usual." It is farther remarkable in
respect to this breed that it is, from its conformation of head,
less adapted to the severe droughts of those regions than the
ordinary cattle, and can not, therefore, be regarded as an
adaptation to circumstances. In his later work on animals under
domestication, Darwin gives many other instances of the
origination of breeds of cattle and other animals in this abrupt
and mysterious manner, and without any selection, though he
strongly leans to the conclusion that slow and gradual changes
are the most frequent causes of variation. It is to be observed,
however, that very slow changes are in more danger of being
accidentally diverted or obliterated by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
crossing, and that the first stages of an incipient change may be too unimportant to be
permanent.</p>

<p>Many writers on the subject of the Unity of Man assume that any
marked variety must require a long time for its production. Our
experience in the case of the domestic animals teaches the
reverse of this view; a very important point too often
overlooked.</p>

<p>3. The duration or permanence of varieties is very different.
Some return at once to the normal type when the causes of change
are removed. Others perpetuate themselves nearly as invariably as
species, and are named races. It is these races only that we are
likely to mistake for true species, since here we have that
permanent reproduction which is one of the characteristics of the
species. The race, however, wants the other characteristics of
species as above stated; and it differs essentially in having
branched from a primitive species, and in not having an
independent origin. It is quite evident that in the absence of
historical evidence we must be very likely to err by supposing
races to have really originated in distinct "primordial forms."
Such error is especially likely to arise if we overlook the fact
of the sudden origination of such races, and their great
permanency if kept distinct. There are two facts which deserve
especial notice, as removing some of the difficulty in such
cases. One is that well-marked races usually originate only in
domesticated animals, or in wild animals which, owing to
accidental circumstances, are placed in abnormal circumstances.
Another is, that there always remains a tendency to return, in
favorable circumstances, to the original type. This tendency to
reversion is much underrated by Darwin and his followers; yet
they constantly recur to it as a means of proving possible
derivation, and their writings abound in examples of it. Perhaps
the most remarkable of these reversions are those which occur
when varieties destitute of all the markings of the original
stock are crossed and reproduce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
those markings, which Darwin
shows to occur in pigeons and domestic fowls. The domesticated
races usually require a certain amount of care to preserve them
in a state of purity, both on this account and on account of the
readiness with which they intermix with other varieties of the
same species. Many very interesting facts in illustration of
these points might be adduced. The domesticated hog differs in
many important characters from the wild boar. In South America
and the West Indies it has returned, in three centuries or less,
to its original form.
<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
The horse is probably not known in a state originally wild, but it has run wild in America and in
Siberia. In the prairies of North America, according to
Catlin
<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
they still show great varieties of color. The same is
the case in Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia
<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
where herds of wild horses have existed since an early period in the
settlement of America. In South America and Siberia they have
assumed a uniform chestnut or bay color. In the plains of Western
America they retain the dimensions and vigor of the better breeds
of domesticated horses. In Sable Island they have already
degenerated to the level of Highland ponies; but in all countries
where they have run wild, the elongated and arched head, high
shoulders, straight back, and other structural characters
probably of the original wild horse, have appeared. We also learn
from such instances that, while races among domesticated animals
may appear suddenly, they revert to the original type, when
unmixed, comparatively slowly; and this especially when the
variation is in the nature of degeneracy.</p>

<p>4. Some characters are more subject to variation than others. In
the higher animals variation takes place very readily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
in the color and texture of the skin and its appendages. This, from its
direct relation to the external world, and ready sympathy with
the condition of the digestive organs, might be expected to take
the lead. In those domesticated animals which are little liable
to vary in other respects, as the cat and duck, the color very
readily changes. Next may be placed the stature and external
proportions, and the form of such appendages as the external ear
and tail. All these characters are very variable in domestic
animals. Next we may place the form of the skull, which, though
little variable in the wild state, is nearly always changed by
domestication. Psychological functions, as the so-called
instincts of animals, are also very liable to change, and to have
these changes perpetuated in races. Very remarkable instances of
this have been collected by Sir C. Lyell
<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
and Dr. Prichard. Lastly, important physiological characters, as the period of
gestation, etc., and the structure of the internal organs
connected with the functions of nutrition, respiration, etc., are
little liable to change, and remain unaffected by the most
extreme variations in other points; and it is, no doubt, in these
more essential and internal parts that the tendency survives to
return under favorable circumstances to the original type.</p>

<p>5. Varieties or races of the same species are fully reproductive
with each other, which is not the case with true species. Mutual
sterility of varieties of the same species is an exceptional
peculiarity, if it ever truly exist; and, on the other hand, the
cross-fertilization of varieties of the same species, whether in
animals or plants, tends to vigorous life, and also to return to
the primitive or average type. On the other hand, intermixture of
distinct species rarely, if ever, occurs freely in nature. It is
generally a result of artificial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
contrivance. Again, hybrids produced from species known to be distinct are either wholly
barren, or barren <i>inter se</i>, reproducing only with one of the
original stocks, and rapidly returning to it; or if ever fertile
<i>inter se</i>, which is somewhat doubtful, rapidly run out. It has
been maintained by Pallas and others, and Darwin leans to this
idea, that there is still another possibility, namely, that of
the perfect and continued fertility of such mixed races,
especially after long domestication; but their proofs are derived
principally from the intermixture of the races of dogs and of
poultry, which are cases actually in dispute at present, as to
the original unity or diversity of the so-called species.</p>

<p>If we apply these considerations to man, our conclusion must be
that, even in his bodily frame, he is not merely specifically but
ordinally distinct from other animals, and that the differences
between races of men are varietal rather than specific. This view
is confirmed by the following facts:</p>

<p>1. The case of man is not that of a wild animal; and it presents
many points of difference even from the case of the domesticated
lower animals. According to the Bible history, man was originally
fitted to subsist on fruits, to inhabit a temperate climate, and
to be exempt from the necessity of destroying or contending with
other animals. This view unquestionably accords very well with
his organization. He still subsists principally on vegetable
food, is most numerous in the warmer regions of the earth; and,
when so subsisting in these regions, is naturally peaceful and
timid. On the whole, however, his habits of life are
artificial&mdash;more so than those of any domesticated animal. He is,
therefore, in the conditions most favorable to variation. Again,
man possesses more than merely animal instincts. His mental
powers permit him to devise means of locomotion, of protection,
of subsistence, far superior to those of any mere animal; and his
dominant will, insatiable in its desires, bends the bodily frame
to uses and exposes it to external influences
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
more various than any inferior animal can dream of. Man is also more educable and
plastic in his constitution than other animals, owing both to his
being less hemmed in by unchanging instincts, and to his physical
frame being less restricted in its adaptations. If a single
species, he is also more widely distributed than any other; and
there are even single races which exceed in their extent of
distribution nearly all the inferior animals. Nor is there
anything in his structure specially to limit him to plains, or
hills, or forests, or coasts, or inland regions. All the causes
which we can suppose likely to produce variation thus meet in
man, who is himself the producer of most of the distinct races
that we observe in the lower animals. If, therefore, we
condescend to compare man with these creatures, it must be under
protest that what we learn from them must be understood with
reference to his greater capabilities.</p>

<p>2. The races of men are deficient in some of the essential
characters of species. It is true that they are reproduced with
considerable permanency; though a great many cases of spontaneous
change, of atavism, or return to the character of progenitors,
and of slow variation under changed conditions, have been
recorded. But the most manifest deficiency in true specific
characters is in the invariable shading-off of one race into
another, and in the entire failure of those who maintain the
distinction of species in the attempt accurately to define their
number and limits. The characters run into each other in such a
manner that no natural arrangement based on the whole can
apparently be arrived at; and when one particular ground is
taken, as color, or shape of skull, the so-called species have
still no distinct limits; and all the arrangements formed differ
from each other, and from the deductions of philology and
history. Thus, from the division of Virey into two species, on
the entirely arbitrary ground of facial angle, to that of Bory de
St. Vincent into fifteen, we have a great number and variety of
distinctions, all incapable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
of zoological definition; or, if
capable of definition, eminently unnatural. There are, in short,
no missing links between the varieties of men corresponding to
that which obtains between man and lower animals.</p>

<p>3. The races of men differ in those points in which the higher
animals usually vary with the greatest facility. The physical
characters chiefly relied on have been color, character of hair,
and form of skull, together with diversities in stature and
general proportion. These are precisely the points in which our
domestic races are most prone to vary. The manner in which these
characters differ in the races of men may be aptly illustrated by
a few examples of the arrangements to which they lead.</p>

<p>Dr. Pickering, of the U. S. Exploring Expedition
<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
&mdash;who does not, however, commit himself to any specific distinctions&mdash;has
arranged the various races of men on the very simple and obvious
ground of color. He obtains in this way four races&mdash;the White,
the Brown, the Blackish-brown, the Black. The distinction is
easy; but it divides races historically, philologically, and
structurally alike; and unites those which, on other grounds,
would be separated. The white race includes the Hamite
Abyssinian, the Semitic Arabian, the Japhetic Greek. The
Ethiopian or Berber is separated from the cognate Abyssinian, and
the dark Hindoo from the paler races speaking like him tongues
allied to the Sanscrit. The Papuan, on the other hand, takes his
place with the Hindoo; while the allied Australian must be
content to rank with the Negro; and the Hottentot is promoted to
a place beside the Malay. It is unnecessary to pursue any farther
the arrangement of this painstaking and conscientious inquirer.
It conclusively demonstrates that the color of the varieties of
the human race must be arbitrary and accidental, and altogether
independent of unity or diversity of origin.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
Some use has been made, by the advocates of diversity of species,
of the quality of the hair in the different races. That of the
Negro is said to be flat in its cross section&mdash;in this respect
approaching to wool; that of the European is oval; and that of
the Mongolian and American round.
<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
The subject has as yet been very imperfectly investigated; but its indications point to
no greater variety than that which occurs in many domesticated
animals&mdash;as, for instance, the hog and sheep. Nay, Dr. Carpenter
states
<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
&mdash;and the writer has satisfied himself of the fact by
his own observation&mdash;that it does not exceed the differences in
the hair from different parts of the body of the same individual.
The human hair, like that of mammals in general, consists of
three tissues: an outer cortical layer, marked by transverse
stri&aelig;, having in man the aspect of delicate lines, but in many
other animals assuming the character of distinct joints or
prominent serrations; a layer of elongated, fibrous cells, to
which the hair owes most of its tenacity; and an inner cylinder
of rounded cells. In the proportionate development of these
several parts, in the quantity of coloring matter present, and in
the transverse section, the human hair differs very considerably
in different parts of the body. It also differs very markedly in
individuals of different complexions. Similar but not greater
differences obtain in the hair of the scalp in different races;
but the flatness of the Negro's hair connects itself inseparably
with the oval of the hair of the ordinary European, and this with
the round observed in some other races. It generally holds that
curled and frizzled hair is flatter than that which is lank and
straight; but this is not constant, for I have found that the
waved or frizzled hair of the New Hebrideans, intermediate
apparently between the Polynesians and Papuans, is nearly
circular in outline, and differs from European hair mainly in the
greater
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
development of the fibrous structure and the intensity
of the color. Large series of comparisons are required; but those
already made point to variation rather than specific difference.
Some facts also appear to indicate very marked differences as
occurring in the same race from constant exposure or habitual
covering; and also the occasional appearance of the most abnormal
forms, without apparent cause, in individuals. The differences
depending on greater or less abundance or vigor of growth of the
hair are obviously altogether trivial, when compared with such
examples as the hairless dogs of Chili and hairless cattle of
Brazil, or even with the differences in this respect observed in
individuals of the same race of men.</p>

<p>Confessedly the most important differences of the races of men
are those of the skeleton, in all parts of which variations of
proportion occur, and are of course more or less communicated to
the muscular investments. Of these, as they exist in the pelvis,
limbs, etc., I need say nothing; for, manifest though they are,
they all fall far within the limits of variation in familiar
domestic animals, and also of hereditary malformation or defect
of development occurring in the European nations, and only
requiring isolation for its perpetuation as a race. The
differences in the skull merit more attention, for it is in this
and in its enclosed brain that man most markedly differs from the
lower animals, as well as race from race. It is in the form
rather than in the mere dimensions of the skull that we should
look for specific differences; and here, adopting the vertical
method of Blumenbach as the most characteristic and valuable, we
find a greater or less antero-posterior diameter&mdash;a greater or
less development of the jaws and bones of the face. The skull of
the normal European, or Caucasian of Cuvier, is round oval; and
the jaws and cheek-bones project little beyond its anterior
margin, when viewed from above. The skull of the Mongolian of
Cuvier is nearly round, and the cheek-bones and jaws project
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
much more strongly in front and at the sides. The Negro skull is
lengthened from back to front; the jaws project strongly, or are
prognathous; but the cheek-bones are little prominent. For the
extremes of these varieties, Retzius proposed the names of
brachy-kephalic or short-headed, and dolicho-kephalic or
long-headed, which have come into general use. The differences
indicated by these terms are of great interest, as distinctive
marks of many of the unmixed races of men; but, when pushed to
extremes, lead to very incorrect generalizations&mdash;as Professor D.
Wilson has well shown in his paper on the supposed uniformity of
type in the American races&mdash;a doctrine which he fully refutes by
showing that within a very narrow geographical range this
primitive and unmixed race presents very great differences of
cranial form.
<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Exclusive of idiots, artificially compressed
heads, and deformities, the differences between the
brachy-kephalic and dolicho-kephalic heads range from equality in
the parietal and longitudinal diameter to the proportion of about
14 to 24. As stated by some ethnologists, these differences
appear quite characteristic and distinct; but, so soon as we
attempt any minute discrimination, all confidence in them as
specific characters disappears. In our ordinary European races
similar differences, and nearly as extensive, occur. The
dolicho-kephalic head is really only an immature form
perpetuated; and appears not only in the Negro, but in the
Esquimau, and in certain ancient and modern Celtic races. The
brachy-kephalic head, in like manner, is characteristic of
certain tribes and portions of tribes of Americans, but not of
all; of many northern Asiatic nations; of certain Celtic and
Scandinavian tribes; and often appears in the modern European
races as an occasional character. Farther, as Retzius has well
shown, the long heads and prominent jaws are not always
associated with each other; and his classification is really the
testimony of an able observer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
against the value of these characters. He shows that the Celtic and Germanic races (in part)
have long heads and straight jaws; while the Negroes,
Australians, Oceanians, Caribs, Greenlanders, etc., have long
heads and prominent jaws. The Laplanders, Finns, Turks, Sclaves,
Persians, etc., have short heads and straight jaws; while the
Tartars, Mongolians, Incas, Malays, Papuans, etc., have short
heads and prominent jaws.</p>

<p>Another defect in the argument often based on the diverse forms
of heads is its want of acknowledgment of the ascertained and
popularly known fact that these forms in different tribes or
individuals of the same race are markedly influenced by culture
and habits of life. In all races ignorance and debasement tend to
induce a prognathous form, while culture tends to the elevation
of the nasal bones, to an orthognathous condition of the jaws,
and to an elevation and expansion of the cranium.
<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Again, no adequate allowance has been made in the case of these
forms of skull for the influence of modes of nurture in infancy.
Dr. Morton, observing that the brachy-kephalic American skull was
often unequal sided, and the occiput much flattened, suggests
that this is "an exaggeration of the natural form produced by the
pressure of the cradle-board in common use among the American
natives." Dr. Wilson has noticed the same unsymmetrical character
in brachy-kephalic skulls in British barrows, and has suspected
some artificial agency in infancy; and says, in reference to the
American instances, "I think it extremely probable that further
investigation will tend to the conclusion that the vertical or
flattened occiput, instead of being a typical characteristic,
pertains entirely to the class of artificial modifications of the
natural cranium familiar to the American ethnologist."</p>

<p>While the points in which the races of men vary are those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
in which lower animals are most liable to undergo change, the
several races display a remarkable constancy in those which are
usually less variable. Prichard and Carpenter have well shown
this in relation to physiological points, as, for instance, the
age of arriving at maturity, the average and extreme duration of
life, and the several periods connected with reproduction. The
coincidence in these points alone is by many eminent
physiologists justly regarded as sufficient evidence of the unity
of the species.</p>

<p>4. It may also be affirmed, in relation to the varieties of man,
that they do not exceed in amount or extent those observed in the
lower animals. If with Frederick Cuvier, Dr. Carpenter, and many
other naturalists, we regard the dog as a single species,
descended in all probability from the wolf, we can have no
hesitation in concluding that this animal far exceeds man in
variability.
<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
But this is denied by many, not without some
show of reason; and we may, therefore, select some animal
respecting which little doubt can be entertained. Perhaps the
best example is the common hog (<i>Sus scrofa</i>), an undoubted
descendant of the wild boar, and a creature especially suitable
for comparison with man, inasmuch as its possible range of food
is very much the same with his, which is not the case with any
other of our domesticated animals; and as its headquarters as a
species are in the same regions which have supported the greatest
and oldest known communities of men. We may exclude from our
comparison the Chinese hog, by some regarded as a distinct
species (<i>Sus Indicus</i>), though no wild original is known, and it
breeds freely with the common hog. The color of the domestic hog
varies, like that of man, from white to black; and in the black
hog the skin as well as the hair partakes of the dark color. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
abundance and quality of the hair vary extremely; the stature and
form are equally variable, much more so than in man. Blumenbach
long ago remarked that the difference between the skull of the
ordinary domestic hog and that of the wild boar is quite equal to
that observed between the Negro and European skulls. Darwin shows
that it is much greater, and illustrates this by an amusing pair
of portraits. The breeds of swine even differ in directions
altogether unparalleled in man. For instance, both in America and
Europe solid-hoofed swine have originated and become a permanent
variety; and there is said to be another variety with five
toes.
<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
These are the more remarkable, because, in the
American instances, there can be no doubt that it is the common
hog which has assumed these abnormal forms.</p>

<p>5. All varieties or races of men intermix freely, in a manner
which strongly indicates specific unity. We hold here, as already
stated, that no good case of a permanent race arising from
intermixture of distinct species of the lower animals has been
adduced; but there is another fact in relation to this subject
which the advocates of specific diversity would do well to study.
Even in varieties of those domestic animals which are certainly
specifically identical, as the hog, the sheep, the ox&mdash;although
crosses between the varieties may easily be produced&mdash;they are
not readily maintained, and sometimes tend to die out. What are
called good crosses lead to improved energy, and continual
breeding in and in of the same variety leads to degeneracy and
decay; but, on the other hand, crosses of certain varieties are
proved by experience to be of weakly and unproductive quality;
and every practical book on cattle contains remarks on the
difficulty of keeping up crosses without intermixture with one of
the pure breeds. It would thus appear that very unlike varieties
of the same species display in this respect, in an imperfect
manner,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
the peculiarities of distinct species. It is on this
principle that I would in part account for some of the
exceptional facts which occur in mixed races of men.</p>

<p>What, then, are the facts in the case of man? In producing
crosses of distinct species, as in the case of the horse and ass,
breeders are obliged to resort to expedients to overcome the
natural repugnance to such intermixture. In the case of even the
most extreme varieties of man, if such repugnance exists, it is
voluntarily overcome, as the slave population of America
testifies abundantly. By far the greater part of the
intermixtures of races of men tend to increase of vital energy
and vigor, as in the case of judicious crosses of some domestic
animals. Where a different result occurs, we usually find
sufficient secondary causes to account for it. I shall refer to
but one such case&mdash;that of the half-breed American Indian. In so
far as I have had opportunities of observation or inquiry, these
people are prolific, much more so than the unmixed Indian. They
are also energetic, and often highly intellectual; but they are
of delicate constitution, especially liable to scrofulous
diseases, and therefore not long-lived. Now this is precisely the
result which often occurs in domestic animals, where a highly
cultivated race is bred with one that is of ruder character and
training; and it very probably results from the circumstance that
the progeny may inherit too much of the delicacy of the one
parent to endure the hardships congenial to the other; or, on the
other hand, too much of the wild nature of the ruder parent to
subsist under the more delicate nurture of the more cultivated.
This difficulty does not apply to the intermixture of the Negro
and the European, though between the pure races this is a cross
too abrupt to be likely to be in the first instance successful.</p>

<p>6. The races of man may have originated in the same manner with
the breeds of our domesticated animals. There are many facts
which render it probable that they did originate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
in this way. Take color, for instance. The fair varieties of man occur only in
the northern temperate zone, and chiefly in the equable climates
of that zone. In extreme climates, even when cold, dusky and
yellow colors appear. The black and blackish-brown colors are
confined to the inter-tropical regions, and appear in such
portions of all the great races of mankind as have been long
domiciled there. Diet and degree of exposure have also evidently
very much to do with form, stature, and color. The deer-eating
Chippewayan of certain districts of North America is a better
developed man than his compatriots who subsist principally on
rabbits and such meaner fare; and excess of carbonaceous food,
and deficiency of perspiration or of combustion in the lungs,
appear everywhere to darken the skin.
<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
The Negro type in its extreme form is peculiar to low and humid river valleys of
tropical Africa. In Australasia similar characters appear in men
of a very different race in similar circumstances. The Mongolian
type reappears in South Africa. The Esquimau is like the Fuegian.
The American Indian, both of South and North America, resembles
the Mongol; but in several of the middle regions of the American
continent men appear who approximate to the Malay. Everywhere and
in all races coarse features and deviations from the oval form of
skull are observed in rude populations. Where men have sunk into
a child-like simplicity, the elongated forms prevail. Where they
have become carnivorous, aggressive, and actively barbarous, the
brachy-kephalic forms abound. These and many other considerations
tend to the conclusion that these varieties are inseparably
connected with external conditions. It may still be asked&mdash;Were
not the races created as they are, with especial reference to
these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
conditions? I answer no&mdash;because the differences are of a
character in every respect like those that appear in other true
species as the results of influences from without.</p>

<p>Farther, not only have we varieties of man resulting from the
slow operation of climatal and other conditions, but we have the
sudden development of races. One remarkable instance may
illustrate my meaning. It is the hairy family of Siam, described
by Mr. Crawford and Mr. Yule.
<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
The peculiarities here consisted of a fine silky coat of hair covering the face and less
thickly the whole body, with at the same time the entire absence
of the canine and molar teeth. The person in whom these
characters originated was sent to Ava as a curiosity when five
years old. He married at twenty-two, his wife being an ordinary
Burmese woman. One of two children who survived infancy had all
the characters of the father. This was a girl; and on her
marriage the same characters reappeared in one of two boys
constituting her family when seen by Mr. Yule. Here was a variety
of a most extreme character, originating without apparent cause,
and capable of propagation for three generations, even when
crossed with the ordinary type. Had it originated in
circumstances favorable to the preservation of its purity, it
might have produced a tribe or nation of hairy men, with no teeth
except incisors. Such a tribe would, with some ethnologists, have
constituted a new and very distinct species; and any one who had
suggested the possibility of its having originated within a few
generations as a variety would have been laughed at for his
credulity. It is unnecessary to cite any further instances. I
merely wish to insist on the necessity of a rigid comparison of
the variations which appear in man, either suddenly or in a slow
or secular manner, with the characters of the so-called races or
species.</p>

<p>7. If we turn from the merely physical constitution of man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span> and
inquire as to his psychical and spiritual endowments, it would be
easy to show, as Dr. Carpenter and others have done, in
opposition to Darwin, that on the one hand an impassable barrier
separates man from the lower animals, and that on the other there
is an essential unity among the races of men. But this subject I
have discussed fully in the concluding chapters of my "Story of
the Earth."</p>

<p>If man is thus so very variable, and if many of his leading
varieties have existed for a very long time, does not the fact
that we have but one species afford very strong evidence that
species change only within fixed limits, and do not pass over
into new specific types. Viewed in this way, variability within
the specific limits becomes in itself one of the strongest
arguments against the doctrine of descent with modification as a
mode of origination of new species.</p>

<p>Let us now add to all this the farther consideration, so well
illustrated in the "Reliqui&aelig; Aquitanic&aelig;" of Christy and Lartet,
that the oldest-known men of the caves and gravels may be placed
in one of the varieties, and this the most widely distributed, of
modern man, and we have a further argument which tells most
strongly against the assumption either of the extreme antiquity
or of the unlimited variability of the human species.</p>

On this subject I may refer naturalists to the
intimate acquaintance with animals and their habits, indicated by
manner of their use as sacred emblems, and as symbols in
hieroglyphic writing. Another illustration is afforded by the
Mosaic narrative of the miracles and plagues connected with the
exodus. The Egyptian king, on this occasion, consulted the
<i>philosophers</i> and <i>augurs</i>. These learned men evidently regarded
the serpent-rod miracle as but a more skilful form of one of the
tricks of serpent-charmers. They showed Pharaoh the possibility
of reddening the Nile water by artificial means, or perhaps by
the development of red alg&aelig; in it. They explained the inroad of
frogs on natural principles, probably referring to the immense
abundance ordinarily of the ova and tadpoles of these creatures
compared with that of the adults. But when the dust of the land
became gnats ("lice" in our version), this was a phenomenon
beyond their experience. Either the species was unknown to them,
or its production out of the dry ground was an anomaly, or they
knew that no larv&aelig; adequate to explain it had previously existed.
In the case of this plague, therefore, comparatively
insignificant and easily simulated, they honestly
confessed&mdash;"This is the finger of God." No better evidence could
be desired that the savans here opposed to Moses were men of high
character and extensive observation. Many other facts of similar
tendency might be cited both from Moses and the Egyptian
monuments.</p>

Much that is very silly has been written as to the
extent of the supposed "optical view" taken by the Hebrew
writers; many worthy literary men appearing to suppose that
<i>scientific</i> views of nature must necessarily be different from
those which we obtain by the evidence of our senses. The very
contrary is the fact; and so long as any writers state correctly
what they observe, without insisting on any fanciful hypotheses,
science has no fault to find with them. What science most detests
is the ignorant speculations of those who have not observed at
all, or have observed imperfectly. It is a leading excellence of
the Hebrew Scriptures that they state facts without giving any
theories to account for them. It is, on the contrary, the
circumstance that unscientific writers will not be content to be
"optical," but must theorize, that spoils much of our modern
literature, especially in its descriptions of nature.</p>

I adopt that view of the date of Job which makes it
precede the Exodus, because the religious ideas of the book are
patriarchal, and it contains no allusions to the Hebrew history
or institutions. Were I to suggest an hypothesis as to its
origin, it would be that it was written or found by Moses when in
exile, and published among his countrymen in Egypt, to revive
their monotheistic religion, and cheer them under the apparent
desertion of their God and the evils of their bondage.</p>

It is impossible to avoid recognizing in
the Greek Theogony, as it appears in Hesiod and the Orphic poems,
an inextricable intermingling of a cosmogony akin to that of
Moses with legendary stories of deceased ancestors; and this has,
I must confess, always appeared to me to be a more rational way
of accounting for it than its reference to mere nature-myths.
Chaos, or space, for the chaos of Hesiod differs from that of
Ovid, came first, then Gaea, the earth, and Tartarus, or the
lower world. Chaos gave birth to Erebos (identical with the
Hebrew Ereb or Erev, evening) and Nyx, or night. These again give
birth to Aether, the equivalent of the Hebrew expanse or
firmament, and to Hemera, the day, and then the heavenly bodies
were perfected. So far the legend is apparently based on some
primitive history of creation, not essentially different from
that of the Bible. But the Greek Theogony here skips suddenly to
the human period; and under the fables of the marriage of Gaea
and Uranos, and the Titans, appears to present to us the
antediluvian world, with its intermarriages of the sons of God
and men, and its Nephelim or Giants, with their mechanic arts and
their crimes. Beyond this, in Kronos and his three sons, and in
the strange history of Zeus, the chief of these, we have a coarse
and fanciful version of the story of the family of Noah, the
insult offered by Ham to his father, and the subsequent quarrels
and dispersion of mankind. The Zeus of Homer appears to be the
elder of the three, or Japheth, the real father of the Greeks,
according to the Bible; but in the time of Hesiod Zeus was the
youngest, perhaps indicating that the worship of the Egyptian
Zeus, Ammon or Ham, had already supplanted among the Greeks that
of their own ancestor. But it is curious that even in the Bible,
though Japhet is said to be the greater, he is placed last in the
lists. After the introduction of Greek savans and literati to
Egypt, about B.C. 660, they began to regard their own mythology
from this point of view, though obliged to be reserved on the
subject. The cosmology of Thales, the astronomy of Anaxagoras,
and the history of Herodotus afford early evidence of this, and
it abounds in later writers. I may refer the reader to Grote
(History of Greece, vol. i.) for an able and agreeable summary of
this subject; and may add that even the few coincidences above
pointed out between Greek mythology and the Bible, independently
of the multitudes of more doubtful character to be found in the
older writers on this subject, appear very wonderful, when we
consider that among the Greeks these vestiges of primitive
religion, whether brought with them from the East or received
from abroad, must have been handed down for a long time by oral
tradition among the people; but obscure though they may be, the
circumstance that some old writers have ridden the resemblances
to death affords no excuse for the prevailing neglect of them in
more modern times.</p>

 Professor Dana thus sums up the various meanings of
the word <i>day</i> in Genesis: "<i>First</i>, in verse 5, the <i>light</i> in
general is called day, the darkness night. <i>Second</i>, in the same
verse, <i>evening and morning</i> make the first day, before the sun
appears. <i>Third</i>, in verse 14, day stands for <i>twelve hours</i>, or
the period of daylight, as dependent on the sun. <i>Fourth</i>, same
verse, in the phrase "days and seasons," day stands for a period
of <i>twenty-four hours</i>. <i>Fifth</i>, at the close of the account, in
verse 4 of the second chapter, day means the <i>whole period of
creation</i>. These uses are the same that we have in our own
language."
Warring, in his book "The Miracle of To-day," has suggested that
the Mosaic days are <i>epochal</i> days, each considered as the close
and culmination of a period. This is an ingenious suggestion, and
very well coincides with the day-period theory as defended in the
text.</p>

 It may be desirable to give here, in a slightly
paraphrased version, but strictly in accordance with the views of
the best expositors, the essential part of the passage in
Hebrews, chap. iv.:
"For God hath spoken in a certain place" (Gen. ii., 2) of the
seventh day in this wise&mdash;'And God did rest on the seventh day
from all his works;' and in this place again&mdash;'They shall not
enter into my rest' (Psa. xcv., 11). Seeing, therefore, it still
remaineth that some enter therein, and they to whom it (God's
Sabbatism) was first proclaimed entered not in, because of
disobedience (in the fall, and afterward in the sin of the
Israelites in the desert), again he fixes a certain day, saying
in David's writings, long after the time of Joshua&mdash;'To-day, if
ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts.' For if Joshua had
given them rest in Canaan, he would not afterward have spoken of
another day. There is therefore yet reserved a keeping of a
Sabbath for the people of God. For he that is entered into his
rest (that is, Jesus Christ, who has finished his work and
entered into his rest in heaven), he himself also rested from his
own works, as God did from his own. Let us therefore earnestly
strive to enter into that rest."

It is evident that in this passage God's Sabbatism, the rest
intended for man in Eden and for Israel in Canaan, Christ's rest
in heaven after finishing his work, and the final heavenly rest
of Christ's people, are all indefinite periods mutually related,
and can not possibly be natural days.</p>

 For the benefit of those who may value ancient
authorities in such matters, and to show that such views may
rationally be entertained independently of geology, I quote the
following passage from Origen: "Cuinam qu&aelig;so sensum habenti
convenienter videbitur dictum, quod dies prima et secunda et
tertia, in quibus et vespera nominatur, et mane, fuerint sine
sole, et sine luna et sine stellis: prima autern dies sine
coelo." So St. Augustine expressly states his belief that the
creative days could not be of the ordinary kind: "Qui dies,
cujusmodi sint, aut perdifficile nobis, aut etiam impossibile est
cogitare, quanto magis discere." Bede also remarks, "Fortassis
hic diei nomen, totius temporis nomen est, et omnia volumina
seculorum hoc vocabulo includit." Many similar opinions of old
commentators might be quoted. It is also not unworthy of note
that the cardinal number is used here, "one day" for first day;
and though the Hebrew grammarians have sought to found on this,
and a few similar passages, a rule that the cardinal may be
substituted for the ordinal, many learned Hebraists insist that
this use of the cardinal number implies singularity and
peculiarity as well as mere priority.</p>

 It is to be observed, however, that on the

 The rendering "sweet influences" in our version may
be correct, but the weight of argument appears to favor the view
of Gesenius that the close bond of union between the stars of
this group is referred to. I think it is Herder who well unites
both views, the Pleiades being bound together in a sisterly
union, and also ushering in the spring by their appearance above
the horizon. Conant applies the whole to the seasons, the bands
of Orion being in this view those of winter.</p>

 The interesting discovery, by Mr. Beale and others,

all these, like the <i>Microlestes</i> of the German trias and the
<i>Amphitherium</i> of the Stonesfeld slate, are small marsupials
belonging to the least perfect type of mammals. The discovery of
so many species of these humbler creatures, goes far to increase

 The Bible specifies, perhaps only as the principal
of these arts, music and musical instruments by Jubal, metallurgy
by Tubalcain, the domestication of cattle and the nomade life by
Jabal. It is highly probable that these inventors are introduced
into the Mosaic record for a theological reason, to point out the
folly of the worship rendered to Phtha, Heph&aelig;stos, Vulcan, Horus,
Phoebus, and other inventors, either traditionary
representatives of the family of Lamech, or other heroes wrongly
identified with them. Very possibly their sister Naamah, "the

 On the Biblical view of
this subject, the so-called Aryan mythology, common to India and
Greece, is either a derivative from the Cushite civilization, or
a spontaneous growth of the Japetic stock scattered by the
Cushite empire. The Semitic and Hamitic mythologies are derived
from the primeval cherubic worship of Eden, corrupted and mixed
with deification of natural objects and stages of the creative
work, and with adoration of deified ancestors and heroes.</p>

 Japheth is "enlargement," his sons are Scythians
and inhabitants of the isles, varying in language and
nationality; and Noah predicts, "God shall enlarge Japheth, he
shall dwell in the tents of Shem, Ham shall be his servant."
These are surely characteristic ethnological traits for a period
so early. On the rationalist view, it may be supposed that this
prediction was not written until the characters in question had
developed themselves; but since the greatest enlargement of
Japheth has occurred since the discovery of America, there would
be quite as good ground for maintaining that Noah's prophecy was
interpolated after the time of Columbus.</p>

delta of the Nile, undertaken by Mr. Horner, there was found a
piece of pottery at a depth which appeared to indicate an
antiquity of 13,371 years. But the basis of the calculation is
the rate of deposit (3-1/2 inches per century) calculated for the
ground around the statue of Rameses II. at Memphis, dated at 1361
B.C.; and Mr. Sharpe has objected that no mud could have been
deposited around that statue from its erection until the
destruction of Memphis, perhaps 800 years B.C. Farther, we have
to take into account the natural or artificial changes of the
river's bed, which in this very place is said to have been
diverted from its course by Menes, and which near Cairo is now
nearly a mile from its former site. The liability to error and
fraud in boring operations is also very well known. It has
farther been suggested that the deep cracks which form in the
soil of Egypt, and the sinking of wells in ancient times, are
other probable causes of error; and it is stated that pieces of
burnt brick, which was not in use in Egypt until the Roman times,
have been found at even greater depths than the pottery referred
to by Mr. Horner. This discovery, at first sight so startling,
and vouched for by a geologist of unquestioned honor and ability,
is thus open to the same doubts with the Guadaloupe skeletons,
the human bones in ossiferous caverns, and that found in the mud
of the Mississippi; all of which have, on examination, proved of
no value as proofs of the geological antiquity of man.</p>

 Perhaps the earliest certain date in Egyptian
history is that of Thothmes III. of the eighteenth dynasty,
ascertained by Birch on astronomical evidence as about 1445 B.C.
(about 1600, Manetho); and it seems nearly certain that before
the eighteenth dynasty, of which this king was the fifth
sovereign, there was no settled general government over all
Egypt.</p>

 The Egyptians seem, like our modern
cattle-breeders, to have taken pride in the initiation and
preservation of varieties. Their sacred bull, Apis, was required
to represent one of the varieties of the ox; and one can scarcely
avoid believing that some of their deified ancestors must have
earned their celebrity as tamers or breeders of animals. At a
later period, the experiments of Jacob with Laban's flock furnish
a curious instance of attempts to induce variation.</p>

 Grammatical structure is no doubt more permanent

 I am quite aware that it may be objected to all
this that it is based on merely negative evidence; but this is
not strictly the case. There are positive indications of these
truths. For example, in the Mesozoic epoch the lacertian reptiles
presented huge elephantine carnivorous and herbivorous
species&mdash;the Megalosaurus, Iguanodon, etc.; flying species, with
hollow bones and ample wings&mdash;the Pterodactyles; and aquatic
whale-like species&mdash;Pliosaurus, Ichthyosaurus, etc. These
creatures actually filled the offices now occupied by the
mammals; and, though lacertian in their affinities, they must
have had circulatory, respiratory, and nervous systems far in
advance of any modern reptiles even of the order of Loricates.</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">EARTH AND MAN.<span style="font-size:80%;">The Story of the Earth and Man. By J. W. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dawson</span>,
LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S., Principal and Vice-Chancellor of McGill
University, Montreal. With Twenty Illustrations. 12mo, Cloth, $1
50.</span></p>

<p style="text-indent:1em;">An admirable book. It is a clear and interesting <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of
the results of geological investigation, told in simple
language, devoid of technicalities. The unscientific reader
will obtain more knowledge of geology in one hour's reading
of this book than he will in a week's study of more
elaborate and professional books upon the same subject. It
is vigorously written, and with a certain picturesqueness
that is exceedingly attractive. The chapters upon primitive
man are peculiarly interesting.&mdash;<i>Saturday Evening Gazette</i>,
Boston.</p>

<p style="text-indent:1em;">The pleasantly written volume before us tells the story of
the paleontology and physical geography of the earth in
prehuman ages, and closes with a discussion of the theories
of the appearance, late in geological time, of man upon the
earth. Dr. Dawson's sketch of paleontology will, we feel
sure, be found interesting by all readers.&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
London.</p>

<p style="text-indent:1em;">Since Hugh Miller's time no scientific geologist has done
more than Principal Dawson to extend popular interest in
this branch of study, to secure attention to its educational
value, or to remove misapprehensions which exist in some
quarters as to the relations of science and Scripture on
geological questions.&mdash;<i>Leisure Hour</i>, London.</p>

<p style="text-indent:1em;">We have read his book with profound interest. It is
intelligible, candid, modest.&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript</i>.</p>
